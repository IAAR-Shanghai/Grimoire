    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence as subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Factual Statements**: Objective sentences typically present facts, information, or descriptions without personal feelings, opinions, or bias. For example, \"japanese animation - or 'anime' for those in the know - boasts one of the fastest growing fan bases in the entertainment industry\" is objective because it states a fact about the anime industry.\n\n   **Method**: Look for statements that can be verified or are widely accepted as true without personal input.\n\n2. **Check for Opinion Indicators**: Subjective sentences often contain words that indicate opinions, beliefs, or feelings, such as \"I think,\" \"beautiful,\" \"terrible,\" etc. If these are absent, the sentence is more likely to be objective.\n\n   **Method**: Scan the sentence for adjectives or phrases that reflect personal judgment or emotion.\n\n3. **Assess the Context**: Sometimes, the context of a sentence can help determine its sentiment. For example, a sentence describing a character's actions in a neutral way is objective, while a sentence praising or criticizing the character is subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Consider the sentence within the larger context of the paragraph or text to determine if it's presenting an opinion or stating a fact.\n\n4. **Look for Subjective Qualifiers**: Words like \"probably,\" \"possibly,\" \"might,\" and \"could\" can indicate uncertainty and subjectivity. However, in some cases, they may be used to present a cautious factual statement, so use judgment.\n\n   **Method**: Evaluate whether these qualifiers are used to express uncertainty or to soften a factual statement.\n\n5. **Determine the Purpose**: Sentences that aim to inform or report are typically objective, while those that aim to persuade or express are more likely to be subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Identify the sentence's purpose by considering whether it's providing information or trying to influence the reader's opinion.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences as subjective or objective. Remember that some sentences may require careful consideration of context and wording to accurately determine their sentiment.",
