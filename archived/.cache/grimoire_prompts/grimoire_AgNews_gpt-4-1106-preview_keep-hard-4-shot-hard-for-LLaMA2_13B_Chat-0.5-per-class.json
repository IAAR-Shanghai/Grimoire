    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the topic of a sentence into World, Sports, Business, or Technology, follow these rules:\n\n1. Identify Key Terms:\n   - Sports: Look for names of teams, athletes, sports terms (e.g., playoffs, goals, coach), and sports organizations (e.g., UEFA, NFL).\n   - Technology: Look for tech-related terms (e.g., iPod, 3G, broadband, IT services), brand names (e.g., Apple, IBM), and tech products (e.g., Ogo Messenger Device).\n   - Business: Look for financial terms (e.g., profits, market, budget), business actions (e.g., cuts duties, expands), and economic indicators (e.g., inflation).\n   - World: Look for geopolitical terms (e.g., elections, UN, security law), international locations (e.g., South Korea, Iraq), and global issues (e.g., human rights, sanctions).\n\n2. Apply the Rule:\n   - Example: \"Marlins Fading in Chase for Playoff Spot\" contains the sports term \"playoff,\" indicating it's about Sports.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for key terms that match the categories above. The presence of specific terms will guide you to the correct classification.\n\n3. Context Matters:\n   - Sometimes, a term could belong to multiple categories. Use the context of the sentence to determine the most relevant topic.\n   - Example: \"Nervous Cubans swap Yankee dollars for pesos\" might seem like a World topic, but the context of banks and currency exchange indicates it's about Business.\n\nKeep the explanations concise and use the method of identifying key terms and applying context to classify sentences accurately.",
