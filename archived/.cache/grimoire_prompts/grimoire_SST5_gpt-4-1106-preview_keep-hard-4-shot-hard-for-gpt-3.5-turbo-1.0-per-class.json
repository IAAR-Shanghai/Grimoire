    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Positive or Negative Keywords**: Look for words that typically indicate a positive or negative sentiment. For example, \"entertaining\" is positive, while \"disappointment\" is negative.\n\n2. **Consider Intensifiers and Diminishers**: Words that intensify (e.g., \"very,\" \"huge\") or diminish (e.g., \"mildly,\" \"somewhat\") the sentiment should adjust the classification accordingly.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Overall Context**: Sometimes, the sentiment is not about individual words but the overall context or tone of the sentence.\n\n4. **Neutral Sentiments**: If the sentence lacks strong positive or negative language or expresses a balanced view, it may be neutral.\n\n**Applying the Rules with Examples**:\n\n- \"entertaining enough, but nothing new\" contains a positive word \"entertaining\" but is diminished by \"but nothing new,\" leading to a negative sentiment.\n- \"a huge disappointment\" has an intensifier \"huge\" amplifying the negative word \"disappointment,\" resulting in a very negative sentiment.\n- \"fun and nimble\" contains two positive words without any negative context, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n- \"harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden\" has a neutral sentiment as it presents a balanced view without strong positive or negative language.\n\n**Method**:\n\n1. Read the sentence carefully.\n2. Identify key sentiment words.\n3. Look for intensifiers or diminishers.\n4. Assess the overall tone and context.\n5. Apply the most fitting sentiment classification based on the above analysis.",
