    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nSummary of Rules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Comprehension of Statement and Question**: Understand the content of the statement and the question being asked. Compare the key elements of both to determine if they match or contradict.\n\n   - Example: If the statement says \"No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet,\" and the question is \"Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq,\" the answer is False because the statement explicitly says \"No Weapons\" were found.\n\n   - Method: Read the statement carefully and identify the main points. Then, read the question and look for those main points or their opposites.\n\n2. **Literal Interpretation**: Take the statement and question literally. Do not infer or assume information that is not provided.\n\n   - Example: If the statement mentions \"Aristide killed a conference,\" it means he stopped or cancelled the conference, not that he murdered someone. Therefore, if the question is about murder, the answer is False.\n\n   - Method: Focus on the exact wording used in both the statement and the question. Avoid adding any meaning that is not explicitly stated.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: Use context to determine the truthfulness of the question based on the statement.\n\n   - Example: If the statement talks about the installation of a new Pope and the question is about whether that person is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, the answer is True.\n\n   - Method: Understand the broader context of the statement to correctly interpret the information provided.\n\n4. **Direct Confirmation or Contradiction**: Look for direct confirmation or contradiction between the statement and the question.\n\n   - Example: If the statement says \"Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients,\" and the question is \"Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer,\" the answer is True because the statement directly confirms the use of Herceptin for breast cancer treatment.\n\n   - Method: Identify if the statement directly supports or refutes the question.\n\n5. **Temporal and Specificity Considerations**: Pay attention to time frames and specificity in both the statement and the question.\n\n   - Example: If the statement refers to actions taken \"Since 1987\" and the question asks about the early 1990s, the answer is False if the statement specifies steps were taken \"since 1987,\" which includes the early 1990s.\n\n   - Method: Match the time frames and specific details mentioned in the statement to those in the question.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can determine the truthfulness of the question based on the provided statement.",

Understand the statement and question: Check if the key points match or contradict.\n2. Take words at face value: Don't add meaning not clearly stated.\n3. Use context and direct evidence: Use the statement's context and look for clear confirmation or contradiction to answer the question."
