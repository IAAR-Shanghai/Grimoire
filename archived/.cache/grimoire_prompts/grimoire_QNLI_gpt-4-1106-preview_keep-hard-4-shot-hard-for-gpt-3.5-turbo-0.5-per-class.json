    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether the given statements are true or false, follow these rules:\n\n1. Fact-Checking:\n   - Compare the statement in the question with the provided information.\n   - If the statement directly matches or is logically consistent with the information, it is true.\n   - If the statement contradicts or is not supported by the information, it is false.\n\n2. Context Understanding:\n   - Understand the context of both the provided information and the question.\n   - Ensure that the statement in the question is relevant to the context of the information given.\n\n3. Specificity and Detail:\n   - Pay attention to specific details such as names, dates, and statistics.\n   - A mismatch in these details usually indicates a false statement.\n\n4. Implications and Inferences:\n   - Assess whether the statement is a reasonable inference from the given information.\n   - If the statement extends beyond the information without logical basis, it is likely false.\n\n5. Vocabulary and Terminology:\n   - Check the meaning of specific terms used in both the question and the information.\n   - If the terms are used correctly and match in both contexts, the statement may be true.\n\nApplying the Rules with Examples:\n\n- For the first example, the information talks about Washington's army being nearly captured in New York, not about martial law. Therefore, the answer is False.\n- In the second example, the manifesto \"Ele Divrei HaBerit\" is mentioned, but there is no mention of Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, so the answer is False.\n- The third example states that Theotokos means \"Godbearer,\" which is a correct translation, so the answer is True.\n- In the fourth example, if Business Insider is indeed the source that rated BYU as the safest campus, then the answer is True.\n- The fifth example provides a specific statistic about crime rates in St. John's, which matches the information, so the answer is True.\n- The sixth example discusses the association of hunting with class or culture in the U.S., and if the information supports the statement, the answer is True.\n- For the seventh example, if the information does not support the possibility of growing an entire plant from a single leaf or cell, the answer is False.\n- In the last example, if the information does not mention the population of the British Isles, the answer is False.\n\nKeep the explanations concise and focused on how to apply each rule to determine the truthfulness of the statement.",
