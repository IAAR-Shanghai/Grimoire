    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Factual Statements**: Objective sentences typically present facts, information, or statements that are not influenced by personal feelings or opinions. For example, \"The Earth revolves around the Sun\" is objective.\n\n   **Method**: Look for statements that can be verified through evidence or are widely accepted as true without personal bias.\n\n2. **Detect Personal Opinions or Emotions**: Subjective sentences express personal opinions, assumptions, emotions, or beliefs. For example, \"Chocolate is the best ice cream flavor\" is subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Look for words that indicate personal preference, belief, or emotion, such as \"I think,\" \"best,\" \"worst,\" or \"beautiful.\"\n\n3. **Check for Descriptive Language**: Descriptive language that aims to evoke emotions or is overly specific to an individual's perspective often indicates subjectivity. For example, \"The breathtaking view of the sunset was mesmerizing\" is subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Identify adjectives or phrases that reflect personal judgment or are intended to influence the reader's emotions.\n\n4. **Assess the Context**: Sometimes, the context of a sentence can help determine its sentiment. Objective sentences are more likely to be found in scientific articles, technical manuals, or news reports, while subjective sentences are common in reviews, editorials, or personal essays.\n\n   **Method**: Consider the source and purpose of the text to help assess whether the sentiment is likely to be subjective or objective.\n\n5. **Look for Indicators of Subjectivity or Objectivity**:\n   - Objective indicators: words like \"data,\" \"research,\" \"statistics,\" \"evidence,\" \"reported,\" etc.\n   - Subjective indicators: words like \"believe,\" \"feel,\" \"think,\" \"seems,\" \"appears,\" etc.\n\n   **Method**: Scan the sentence for these keywords as they can be strong indicators of the sentiment.\n\nBy applying these rules and methods, you can classify sentences into subjective or objective categories. Remember to keep the analysis concise and focused on these key aspects.",
