    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the topic of a sentence into World, Sports, Business, or Technology, follow these rules:\n\n1. Identify Key Terms:\n   - For Sports, look for names of sports teams, athletes, sports terms (e.g., \"pitcher,\" \"racecourses\"), or events related to sports.\n   - For Business, search for terms related to commerce, companies, financial markets, or economic indicators.\n   - For World, look for geographical names, international events, or global issues.\n   - For Technology, identify words related to gadgets, software, tech companies, or technological advancements.\n\n   Example: \"Leeds United\" and \"bid\" suggest a sports context, so the classification is Sports.\n\n2. Contextual Clues:\n   - Consider the overall context. If the sentence discusses an event's impact on society or a country, it may be World.\n   - If the focus is on competition, scores, or athletic performance, it's likely Sports.\n   - If the sentence involves financial transactions, market trends, or business decisions, it's Business.\n   - If there's mention of technological developments, digital trends, or IT companies, it's Technology.\n\n   Example: \"Victoria's Secret has arrived in Tehran\" indicates a global cultural shift, so the classification is World.\n\n3. Apply the Rule:\n   - Match the identified key terms and contextual clues to the appropriate category.\n   - If multiple categories seem possible, prioritize the most dominant theme in the sentence.\n\n   Example: \"IBM expands into Danish IT services market\" contains the tech company IBM and mentions IT services, so the classification is Technology.\n\nRemember to keep the explanation concise and focused on the dominant theme of the sentence for accurate classification.",
