    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Hate Speech Indicators:**\n   - Look for derogatory language targeting a group based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion.\n   - Example: The use of the word \"NIGGER\" in a derogatory way indicates hate speech.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for slurs, insults, or pejorative terms associated with discrimination.\n\n2. **Assess Intent to Harm or Demean:**\n   - Determine if the sentence expresses an intent to harm, demean, or dehumanize an individual or group.\n   - Example: \"Stupid feminists. For FUCK sake! Just....Just....fucking kill yourself.\" shows an intent to harm.\n   - Method: Evaluate the sentence for violent language, threats, or suggestions of harm.\n\n3. **Evaluate Context and Tone:**\n   - Consider the overall context and tone of the sentence to understand if it's promoting hate or simply making an observation or statement.\n   - Example: \"People are genuinely good, we just learned to hate.\" is an observation, not promoting hate.\n   - Method: Look beyond individual words to the message and sentiment being conveyed as a whole.\n\n4. **Check for Advocacy of Equality or Rights:**\n   - Sentences that advocate for human rights, equality, and acceptance are generally not hate speech.\n   - Example: Advocating for human rights and equality, as in the sentence about believing in human rights, is classified as \"no hate.\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence supports inclusivity and equal treatment of all people.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Fear and Hate:**\n   - Expressions of personal fear or discomfort do not necessarily equate to hate speech unless they also include derogatory language or intent to demean.\n   - Example: \"Huh kids like this with crazy eyes and weird moves lurking around are scary.\" expresses discomfort but lacks hate speech indicators.\n   - Method: Differentiate between personal expressions of fear and statements that cast a group in a negative light.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on the presence of hate speech indicators, intent to harm, context, advocacy for equality, and the distinction between fear and hate.",
