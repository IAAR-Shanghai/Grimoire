Abbreviation:\n   - Look for sentences asking for the meaning of a short form or acronym.\n   - Example: \"What does NASA stand for?\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence seeks the expanded form of an abbreviation or acronym.\n\n2. Entity:\n   - Identify sentences that inquire about a thing, concept, or non-personal noun.\n   - Example: \"What is the chemical formula for water?\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence is asking for the name or nature of an object, concept, or term.\n\n3. Description:\n   - Look for sentences that ask for an explanation, significance, or definition.\n   - Example: \"Why is the sky blue?\"\n   - Method: Check if the sentence requires a descriptive or explanatory response.\n\n4. Person:\n   - Identify sentences that refer to a person or group of people.\n   - Example: \"Who is the current President of the United States?\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence is about an individual or a collective group of individuals.\n\n5. Location:\n   - Look for sentences asking about a place or where something can be found.\n   - Example: \"Where is the Eiffel Tower located?\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is seeking the location of an object, event, or place.\n\n6. Number:\n   - Identify sentences that inquire about quantities, statistics, or numerical data.\n   - Example: \"How many continents are there on Earth?\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence is asking for a numerical value or involves counting.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence and using the context to classify it into the correct category.",
