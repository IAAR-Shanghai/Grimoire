    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Factual Statements:\n   - Objective sentences typically present facts, descriptions, or report events without personal feelings or opinions.\n   - Example: \"The book was published in 2001.\" (Objective - states a fact)\n   - Method: Look for statements that can be verified as true or false without personal interpretation.\n\n2. Look for Personal Pronouns and Emotional Language:\n   - Subjective sentences often contain personal pronouns (I, we, you, he, she, they) and words that express feelings, beliefs, or opinions.\n   - Example: \"I believe the book was incredibly moving and profound.\" (Subjective - expresses a personal belief and uses emotional language)\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for personal pronouns and emotionally charged words.\n\n3. Assess the Presence of Opinion Indicators:\n   - Subjective sentences may include words that indicate an opinion, such as \"think,\" \"feel,\" \"seems,\" \"probably,\" \"possibly,\" etc.\n   - Example: \"It seems like the author could have ended the story better.\" (Subjective - indicates an opinion)\n   - Method: Identify words that suggest the sentence is based on personal judgment rather than fact.\n\n4. Determine the Purpose of the Sentence:\n   - Objective sentences are used to inform, explain, or describe without bias.\n   - Subjective sentences are used to share personal perspectives, experiences, or evaluations.\n   - Method: Consider the intent behind the sentenceâ€”is it meant to convey information neutrally or to express a personal viewpoint?\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of a sentence as subjective or objective. Remember to keep the analysis concise and focused on these key indicators.",
