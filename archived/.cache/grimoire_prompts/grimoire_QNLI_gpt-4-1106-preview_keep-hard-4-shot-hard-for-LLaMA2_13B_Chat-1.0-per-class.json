    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether the provided statement is true or false based on the given information, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Key Terms**: Extract the main subjects and predicates from the question and the statement.\n   - Example: For the question about the song referencing the state that KU serves, the key terms are \"song,\" \"references,\" \"state,\" and \"KU serves.\"\n\n2. **Compare Information**: Check if the key terms and their relationships in the statement match the information provided in the question.\n   - Method: Look for direct matches or contradictions between the statement and the question.\n   - Example: The statement about \"Iâ€™m a Jayhawk\" and \"Fighting Jayhawk\" does not confirm that these songs reference the state, hence the answer is False.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the context of the information to interpret it correctly.\n   - Method: Use common knowledge or the provided context to infer the correct answer when the statement is not explicit.\n   - Example: The statement about Chopin's health does not directly mention his cause of death, so the answer is False.\n\n4. **Direct Confirmation or Refutation**: If the statement directly confirms or refutes the information in the question, that determines the answer.\n   - Method: Look for explicit affirmations or denials.\n   - Example: The statement about crime in St. John's directly matches the question, confirming an increase of 4%, so the answer is True.\n\n5. **Implication and Inference**: Sometimes the answer is not directly stated but can be inferred from the information.\n   - Method: Deduce the answer from the implications of the provided information.\n   - Example: The statement about hunting not being associated with any particular class or culture implies a broad acceptance, which matches the question, so the answer is True.\n\n6. **Accuracy of Translation or Definition**: When the question involves a translation or definition, verify its accuracy.\n   - Method: Compare the provided translation or definition with the statement.\n   - Example: The translation of \"Theotokos\" is directly confirmed in the statement, so the answer is True.\n\n7. **Credibility of Source**: If the question asks about the source of a rating or claim, confirm the credibility of the source mentioned.\n   - Method: Check if the statement names the source as claimed in the question.\n   - Example: If Business Insider is mentioned as the source for BYU's safety rating, the answer is True.\n\nKeep the answers concise and focused on these rules for determining the truthfulness of the statements.",
    "simple_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo decide if a statement is true or false:\n\n1. **Find Key Points**: Identify the main subjects and actions in both the question and the statement.\n2. **Check Matches or Differences**: Compare the key points to see if they align or contradict.\n3. **Use Context and Inference**: Understand the broader context and infer answers when not explicitly stated."
