    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Intensity Modifiers:\n   - Words like \"very\" or \"extremely\" amplify the sentiment. \n   - Example: \"very low\" suggests a stronger sentiment than just \"low.\"\n   - Method: Look for these modifiers near adjectives or adverbs to determine if the sentiment is \"very positive/negative.\"\n\n2. Look for Sentiment Indicators:\n   - Positive words/phrases indicate a positive sentiment (e.g., \"brilliant,\" \"fun\").\n   - Negative words/phrases indicate a negative sentiment (e.g., \"disappointment,\" \"uninteresting\").\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for these keywords to classify the sentiment.\n\n3. Consider Context and Sarcasm:\n   - Some sentences may contain sarcasm or complex contexts that affect sentiment.\n   - Example: \"laughable and compulsively watchable\" might seem negative but is positive in context.\n   - Method: Evaluate the overall meaning of the sentence, not just individual words.\n\n4. Neutral Sentiments:\n   - Sentences without clear positive or negative language are often neutral.\n   - Example: \"there's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane.\"\n   - Method: If the sentence lacks emotional language, it's likely neutral.\n\n5. Use of Negations:\n   - Negations can reverse the sentiment of a word (e.g., \"not good\" is negative).\n   - Method: Detect negations and adjust the sentiment accordingly.\n\n6. Assess the Overall Message:\n   - The sentiment is derived from the overall message rather than isolated words.\n   - Example: \"a huge disappointment\" indicates a strong negative sentiment.\n   - Method: Summarize the main point of the sentence to determine sentiment.\n\n7. Sentiment Ambiguity:\n   - Some sentences may have ambiguous sentiments or mixed messages.\n   - Method: In such cases, lean towards the dominant sentiment or classify as neutral if evenly balanced.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences into the categories of very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative.",
