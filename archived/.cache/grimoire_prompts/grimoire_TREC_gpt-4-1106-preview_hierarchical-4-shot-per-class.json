Number: If the sentence asks for a quantity, count, or date, classify it as \"Number.\"\n   - Example: \"How many mountains have been named for Presidents in the continental USA?\" \n   - Method: Look for words like \"how many,\" \"when,\" or any other terms that imply numerical information.\n\n2. Person: If the sentence inquires about an individual or a group of people, classify it as \"Person.\"\n   - Example: \"Who painted 'Soft Self-Portrait with Grilled Bacon'?\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is asking for a name or title of a person or persons.\n\n3. Location: If the sentence pertains to a geographical place or a physical location, classify it as \"Location.\"\n   - Example: \"What city is near the mouth of the Amazon?\"\n   - Method: Detect keywords that indicate places, such as \"city,\" \"country,\" \"near,\" etc.\n\n4. Entity: If the sentence refers to an object, concept, or non-human living thing, classify it as \"Entity.\"\n   - Example: \"What animal dined on bread and oysters with a carpenter?\"\n   - Method: Look for nouns that are not people or places but are tangible or intangible entities.\n\n5. Description: If the sentence asks for an explanation, reason, or description of a concept or action, classify it as \"Description.\"\n   - Example: \"Why do we have to go to school?\"\n   - Method: Identify sentences that require an explanatory or descriptive response rather than factual information.\n\n6. Abbreviation: If the sentence is asking for the meaning of an abbreviated term or acronym, classify it as \"Abbreviation.\"\n   - Example: \"What does 'B.Y.O.B.' mean?\"\n   - Method: Look for shortened forms of words or acronyms and sentences that ask what they stand for.\n\nApply these rules by identifying key words or phrases in the sentence that align with the definitions provided for each category.",
