    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Language or Insults:**\n   - If a sentence contains derogatory terms, explicit insults, or offensive language directed at a person or group, it is likely to be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Stupid feminists. For FUCK sake! Just....Just....fucking kill yourself.\"\n   - Method: Scan for words that are commonly used as insults or that demean a group based on race, gender, nationality, disability, etc.\n\n2. **Assess the Context for Aggression or Harm:**\n   - Sentences that express a desire for harm or violence towards individuals or groups, or that are aggressively dismissive or disrespectful, should be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Islam is pig shit\"\n   - Method: Look for phrases that suggest violence, harm, or extreme disrespect.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Tone and Intent:**\n   - Even if a sentence does not contain explicit negative language, a mocking or sarcastic tone, especially when mimicking accents or cultural mannerisms, can indicate \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Hello I'm calling from tech support *with Indian accent*\"\n   - Method: Consider whether the sentence is mocking someone's identity or culture.\n\n4. **Consider the Presence of Stereotypes or Prejudices:**\n   - Sentences that promote stereotypes or reflect prejudiced views should be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Fucking Canada...stupid. I think the cold shrinks their brains.\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is perpetuating negative stereotypes or generalizations.\n\n5. **Neutral or Positive Sentences:**\n   - If a sentence does not contain any of the above elements and is neutral or positive in nature, it should be classified as \"no hate.\"\n   - Example: \"People with autism are so nice\"\n   - Method: Confirm the absence of negative language, aggression, mocking tones, and stereotypes.\n\nRemember to apply these rules with sensitivity to context and cultural nuances. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and consider the potential impact of the sentence on the targeted individual or group.",
