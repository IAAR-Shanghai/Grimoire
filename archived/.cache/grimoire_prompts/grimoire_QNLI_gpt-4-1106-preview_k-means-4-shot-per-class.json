    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. Identify Key Information:\n   - Extract the main subject and predicate from the question.\n   - Example: For \"What percentage of the South Tuscon Population is Mexican-American?\", the main subject is \"South Tuscon Population\" and the predicate is \"percentage that is Mexican-American\".\n\n2. Match Information:\n   - Compare the key information from the question with the provided statement.\n   - Method: Look for direct matches or logical implications that confirm or deny the question.\n   - Example: The question about South Tuscon matches the statement saying \"83% Mexican-American\", confirming it as True.\n\n3. Contextual Understanding:\n   - Understand the context of the question to evaluate the truthfulness of the statement.\n   - Method: Use general knowledge or the context provided to assess if the statement logically supports the question.\n   - Example: The question about the devotion of time influenced by Christianity is supported by the statement mentioning Christianity's profound effect on Greek culture, making it True.\n\n4. Specificity and Relevance:\n   - Ensure the statement directly addresses the question without introducing irrelevant information.\n   - Method: Disregard any information that does not pertain to the specific question.\n   - Example: The question about the Bronx's Hispanic and Latino population is not answered by the statement about Asian Americans, making it False.\n\n5. Logical Deduction:\n   - Use logical reasoning to deduce the truthfulness when the statement does not directly answer the question but provides related information.\n   - Method: Infer the answer based on the implications of the provided information.\n   - Example: The question about the oldest church in Plymouth is not directly answered, but the statement about the largest parish church in Devon being a site of gathering since AD 800 does not confirm it as the oldest, making it False.\n\nRemember to keep the explanations concise and focused on the method of applying each rule.",

Find the main points: Look for the main topic and detail in the question.\n2. Check for matches: Compare the main points to the given information to see if they agree.\n3. Use logic and context: Apply common sense and the given context to decide if the information supports the question."
