    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify the Core Statement**: Extract the main fact or claim from the question.\n   - Example: \"Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.\"\n   - Method: Read the question carefully and determine the key information it is asking about.\n\n2. **Match Information**: Compare the core statement with the information given in the example text.\n   - Example: The text states Valero Energy Corp. found damage at its refinery, which has a capacity of 250,000 barrels per day.\n   - Method: Look for the core statement within the text to see if it is directly supported or refuted.\n\n3. **Understand Implications**: Determine if the statement is a direct fact or if it implies a fact.\n   - Example: Lin Piao being the creator of Mao's \"Little Red Book\" implies he wrote it.\n   - Method: Consider the broader context and implications of the statement to see if it indirectly confirms the question.\n\n4. **Assess Contextual Clues**: Use context to infer the truthfulness of the statement.\n   - Example: The text about the Bundesbank shows opposition to the euro, confirming the statement.\n   - Method: Read around the core statement in the text to understand the circumstances and context.\n\n5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Do not infer facts not directly or indirectly supported by the text.\n   - Example: The text does not state that Everglades National Park is in Florida, so the answer is False.\n   - Method: Stick to the information provided without adding external knowledge or assumptions.\n\n6. **Check for Logical Errors**: Ensure the statement is logically consistent with the text.\n   - Example: The text about U.S. crude prices does not logically support the phrasing of the question, so the answer is False.\n   - Method: Analyze the statement for logical consistency with the given information.\n\n7. **Evaluate Relevance**: Determine if the statement is relevant to the question.\n   - Example: The text about American tobacco companies does not mention PM (Philip Morris) specifically, so the answer is False.\n   - Method: Confirm that the statement pertains directly to the subject of the question.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can systematically evaluate each question and determine whether the answer is True or False based on the provided text.",
