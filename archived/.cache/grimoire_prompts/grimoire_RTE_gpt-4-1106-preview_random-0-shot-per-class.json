    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of outputting \"True\" or \"False\" in response to a question, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: Ensure you comprehend the question fully. If the question is \"Is the sky blue?\", you need to know that the sky is generally perceived as blue during a clear day.\n\n2. **Fact-Checking**: Verify the statement against known facts or information. For the sky example, you would confirm that the sky is indeed blue on a clear day.\n\n3. **Context Consideration**: Take into account the context of the question. If the question is \"Is the sky blue at night?\", the context changes the answer since the sky is not blue at night.\n\n4. **Answer Concisely**: After evaluating the question, respond with only \"True\" or \"False\" without additional explanation.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: \"Do birds fly?\"\n- Understand: Know that birds are a group of animals with wings.\n- Fact-Check: Most birds can fly.\n- Context Consideration: If there's no specific context that suggests otherwise (like talking about penguins or ostriches), assume a general context.\n- Answer: True\n\nMethod:\n- Read the question carefully.\n- Compare the question to your knowledge or look up reliable information if unsure.\n- Consider any given context.\n- Respond with \"True\" or \"False\" based on your assessment.",
