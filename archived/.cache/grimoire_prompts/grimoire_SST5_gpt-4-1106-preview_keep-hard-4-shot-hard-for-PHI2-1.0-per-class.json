    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Key Words: Look for words that typically carry strong sentiment, such as \"disappointment,\" \"bad,\" \"good,\" \"fun,\" or \"dull.\" \n   - Example: \"disappointment\" indicates a negative sentiment.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for emotionally charged words.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers and Diminishers: Words that intensify (e.g., \"huge,\" \"brilliant\") suggest very positive or very negative sentiments, while words that diminish (e.g., \"somewhat,\" \"a bit\") may indicate a more neutral stance.\n   - Example: \"huge disappointment\" is very negative.\n   - Method: Evaluate the degree of sentiment based on modifiers.\n\n3. Analyze Context: Sentiment can be affected by context, such as negations (\"not interesting\") or comparisons (\"more ingeniously constructed than\").\n   - Example: \"not interesting\" flips the sentiment to negative.\n   - Method: Look at the sentence structure and surrounding words to understand the sentiment.\n\n4. Look for Sarcasm or Irony: Sometimes, the literal meaning may not represent the true sentiment due to sarcasm or irony.\n   - Example: \"suck up to this project\" likely indicates a negative sentiment despite the positive words.\n   - Method: Consider the tone and possible sarcasm when interpreting sentiment.\n\n5. Neutral Sentiments: Sentences that state facts without emotional words or that express indifference are often neutral.\n   - Example: \"you want to call Domino's\" is neutral.\n   - Method: If there's an absence of sentiment words or emotional context, classify as neutral.\n\n6. Sentiment in Comparisons: When a sentence compares something to another, the sentiment is often based on whether the comparison is favorable or not.\n   - Example: \"a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than 'Memento'\" is very positive.\n   - Method: Determine if the comparison implies a better or worse quality.\n\n7. Sentiment in Expectations: If a sentence indicates expectations being met or not, this can determine sentiment.\n   - Example: \"succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails\" is positive.\n   - Method: Assess if the sentence suggests fulfillment or disappointment of expectations.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, identifying the sentiment-bearing words, considering the context, and using the guidelines above to classify the sentiment accordingly.",

Identify neutral statements without emotional words or context, and consider sarcasm or irony when present."
