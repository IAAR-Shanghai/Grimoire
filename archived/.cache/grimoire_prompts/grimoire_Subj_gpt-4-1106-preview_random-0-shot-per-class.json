    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Subjectivity**: A subjective sentence expresses personal feelings, opinions, or beliefs. For example, \"I love this beautiful weather!\" shows personal enjoyment, thus it's subjective.\n\n   *Method*: Look for opinion words, emotional language, or first-person pronouns that indicate a personal stance.\n\n2. **Identify Objectivity**: An objective sentence states facts, information, or things that can be verified and are not influenced by personal feelings. For example, \"The conference starts at 9 AM.\" is stating a fact, so it's objective.\n\n   *Method*: Check if the sentence can be proven true or false with evidence. If it can, it's likely objective.\n\n3. **Check for Modifiers**: Words like \"probably,\" \"possibly,\" \"might,\" and \"could\" can introduce uncertainty and subjectivity.\n\n   *Method*: Evaluate if these modifiers are used to express likelihoods/opinions or to report uncertainty in a factual context.\n\n4. **Consider Context**: Sometimes, the context of a sentence can influence its classification. A sentence might seem objective but could be subjective in a different context.\n\n   *Method*: Look at surrounding sentences or the overall topic to determine if the sentiment is being influenced by context.\n\n5. **Use Tools if Necessary**: If you're unsure, you can use sentiment analysis tools or checklists to help classify the sentiment.\n\n   *Method*: Input the sentence into a sentiment analysis tool or compare it against a checklist of subjective/objective indicators.\n\nRemember to keep the explanation concise and provide clear examples and methods for applying each rule.",
