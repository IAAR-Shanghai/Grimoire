    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into \"Hate\" or \"No Hate\":\n\n1. Identify Hate Speech:\n   - Hate speech typically targets a person or group based on attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.\n   - Example: A sentence that suggests harm or expresses severe disrespect towards a group or individual based on these attributes should be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Method: Look for derogatory language, stereotypes, or suggestions of violence or discrimination.\n\n2. Context Matters:\n   - Sometimes, a sentence may contain words that are often associated with hate speech but are used in a non-hateful context.\n   - Example: \"I'm white, I'm proud to be white, I love diversity and people of all nations.... lets move on. :)\" This sentence mentions race but promotes diversity and unity, so it's \"no hate.\"\n   - Method: Consider the overall message and intent of the sentence, not just individual words.\n\n3. Tone and Intent:\n   - The tone of a sentence can indicate whether it's hate speech. A hateful tone is often aggressive, mocking, or derogatory.\n   - Example: \"If I were your dad, I'd Google 'Abortions at 30 years old mentally handicapped'.\" This sentence has a mocking and derogatory tone, so it's \"hate.\"\n   - Method: Assess the tone and look for signs of aggression or mockery towards a particular group or individual.\n\n4. Supportive or Positive Messages:\n   - Sentences that express support, love, or respect towards others, especially marginalized groups, are typically \"no hate.\"\n   - Example: \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone. And when I mean everyone I mean everyone I'm a Christian and pansexual I respect every single person in the lgbtq+ community.\"\n   - Method: Identify affirming language and positive sentiments towards individuals or groups.\n\n5. Criticism or Dislike Without Hate:\n   - Expressing criticism or dislike in a respectful way is not hate speech.\n   - Example: \"Gosh you guys are getting less funny with each episode.\" This sentence expresses a personal opinion without targeting anyone based on protected attributes, so it's \"no hate.\"\n   - Method: Distinguish between general criticism or negative feedback and targeted hate speech.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, considering the context, tone, and intent, and looking for any signs of targeted aggression or discrimination. If such signs are absent and the message is positive or neutral, classify the sentence as \"no hate.\"",
