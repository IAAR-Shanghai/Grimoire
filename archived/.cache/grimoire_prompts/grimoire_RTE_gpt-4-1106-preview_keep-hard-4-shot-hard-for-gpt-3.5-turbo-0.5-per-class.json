    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. Fact-Checking:\n   - Compare the statement in the question with the information provided.\n   - Example: If the text says \"No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet,\" and the question asks if they were found, the answer is False.\n\n2. Interpretation:\n   - Understand the context and meaning of both the text and the question.\n   - Example: If the text mentions \"Aristide killed a conference,\" it means he stopped or cancelled the conference, not that he murdered someone.\n\n3. Synonyms and Paraphrasing:\n   - Recognize synonyms or paraphrased text that convey the same meaning.\n   - Example: If the text says \"Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients,\" and the question is about treating breast cancer, the answer is True.\n\n4. Specificity and Detail:\n   - Pay attention to specific details that can change the meaning.\n   - Example: If the text states \"Valero Energy Corp. found damage at its refinery,\" and the question is about production capacity, not actual production, the answer is True.\n\n5. Timeframe and Context:\n   - Consider the timeframe and context given in the text.\n   - Example: If the text talks about actions taken since 1987 and the question refers to the early 1990s, check if the actions mentioned fit within that period.\n\n6. Literal vs. Figurative Language:\n   - Distinguish between literal statements and figurative or idiomatic expressions.\n   - Example: If the text says \"Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's 'Little Red Book',\" it means he compiled or wrote it, so the answer is True.\n\n7. Logical Inference:\n   - Sometimes you may need to infer information based on what is implied in the text.\n   - Example: If the text discusses the price of crude oil settling at a lower value, and the question rephrases it in a confusing way, focus on the price change to determine the answer.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading both the text and the question, analyzing the information given, and then determining whether the statement in the question is supported by the text (True) or not (False).",
