    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Comprehension**: Understand the content of both the statement and the question. You must be able to identify the key elements in the question that are being asked about the statement.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question is \"What year was Raskin hired by Apple?\" and the statement says \"Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979,\" the key element is the year Raskin was involved with hiring for Apple.\n   - *Method*: Read both the statement and the question carefully to identify the key elements that need to be matched or contrasted.\n\n2. **Comparison**: Compare the key elements of the question with the information provided in the statement to determine if they align or contradict each other.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about the increase in crime in St. John's in 2009 and the statement confirms a 4% increase, compare this to the national decrease mentioned.\n   - *Method*: Look for specific figures, names, events, or facts in the statement that directly answer the question.\n\n3. **True or False Determination**: Decide if the statement supports (True) or contradicts (False) the question.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question is about a manifesto named \"Ele Divrei HaBerit\" and the statement discusses opposition to a new temple but does not confirm the manifesto's name, the answer is False.\n   - *Method*: If the statement directly supports the question, answer True. If the statement contradicts or does not provide enough information to support the question, answer False.\n\nKeep the explanation concise and focused on the method of matching key elements from the question to the information in the statement to determine the truthfulness.",
