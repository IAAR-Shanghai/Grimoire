Location: If the sentence is asking about a geographical place or a physical venue, classify it as \"Location.\"\n   - Example: \"What city is served by McCarren Airport?\"\n   - Method: Look for words indicating places, such as \"where,\" \"city,\" \"country,\" or specific place names.\n\n6. Description: If the sentence seeks an explanation, definition, or significance of a concept, classify it as \"Description.\"\n   - Example: \"What is the Bernoulli Principle?\"\n   - Method: Identify sentences that require an explanation or definition, often starting with \"What is\" or \"What was the importance of.\"\n\nKeep the classification concise and based on the key words or phrases that indicate the category of the topic.",
