    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Factual Statements**: Objective sentences typically present facts, events, or descriptions without personal feelings or opinions. For example, \"the focus of this story takes place at an annual drag-racing event in Fresno\" is a factual description of a story setting, hence it's objective.\n\n   **Method**: Look for sentences that state information that can be verified and is not influenced by personal feelings.\n\n2. **Look for Personal Opinions or Emotions**: Subjective sentences express personal feelings, beliefs, or opinions. If a sentence includes words that indicate judgment, belief, or emotion, it is likely subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Scan the sentence for adjectives or verbs that reflect personal perspective, emotions, or judgments (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"hate,\" \"wonderful\"). If such words are absent, the sentence is more likely to be objective.\n\n3. **Check for Speculative Language**: Sentences that speculate or hypothesize about possibilities rather than stating confirmed information may be subjective.\n\n   **Method**: Identify if the sentence is discussing potential scenarios or making assumptions rather than stating known facts.\n\n4. **Assess the Context**: Sometimes, the context of a sentence can help determine if it's subjective or objective. If the sentence is part of a larger narrative that is factual and neutral, it's likely objective.\n\n   **Method**: Consider the sentence within the larger context of the paragraph or text it is part of to determine its sentiment.\n\n5. **Determine the Purpose**: Objective sentences often aim to inform or report, while subjective sentences aim to persuade, entertain, or express.\n\n   **Method**: Ask what the sentence is trying to achieve. If it's providing information without trying to influence the reader's emotions or opinions, it's objective.\n\nIn all the provided examples, the sentences describe events, characters, and scenarios without expressing personal opinions or emotions, which is why they are classified as objective.",
