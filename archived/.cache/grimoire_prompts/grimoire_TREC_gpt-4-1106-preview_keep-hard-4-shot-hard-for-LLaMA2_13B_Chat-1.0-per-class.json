    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nSummary of Rules for Classifying Sentence Topics:\n\n1. Abbreviation:\n   - Identify sentences asking for the meaning of an acronym or shortened form of a word or phrase.\n   - Example: \"What does NASA stand for?\" would be classified as Abbreviation.\n   - Method: Look for phrases like \"stand for,\" \"acronym for,\" \"abbreviated expression for,\" or any mention of initials.\n\n2. Entity:\n   - Classify sentences that inquire about a non-human object, concept, or collective group.\n   - Example: \"What is the symbol for the Euro?\" would be classified as Entity.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is asking about a thing, concept, or group rather than a specific person, place, or number.\n\n3. Description:\n   - Use this category for sentences that ask for an explanation, definition, or characteristic of something.\n   - Example: \"What is photosynthesis?\" would be classified as Description.\n   - Method: Look for \"What is\" followed by a noun that is not a person, place, or specific measurable quantity.\n\n4. Person:\n   - Sentences that refer to an individual or a group of people by name or by a defining action.\n   - Example: \"Who is the CEO of Apple?\" would be classified as Person.\n   - Method: Detect the presence of \"Who\" or any reference to a person's title, name, or a group defined by a person.\n\n5. Location:\n   - Assign this category to sentences that seek information about a place or a source of information.\n   - Example: \"Where is the Eiffel Tower located?\" would be classified as Location.\n   - Method: Identify questions starting with \"Where\" or asking about the location of something or where to find information.\n\n6. Number:\n   - Choose this category for sentences that request a quantity, age, measurement, or any numerical value.\n   - Example: \"How old is the universe?\" would be classified as Number.\n   - Method: Look for questions starting with \"How many,\" \"How much,\" \"What is the number of,\" or any other inquiry about quantities or numerical data.",
