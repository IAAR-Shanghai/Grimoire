    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Positive or Negative Keywords:\n   - Positive sentiment often includes words like \"amusing,\" \"enjoyed,\" \"best,\" \"fabulous,\" \"solid,\" \"delicious,\" and \"effective.\"\n   - Negative sentiment often includes words like \"disappointment,\" \"uninteresting,\" \"letdown,\" \"bad,\" \"baffling,\" \"old-fashioned,\" \"strains,\" and \"wrecks.\"\n\n   Method: Scan the sentence for these keywords to determine the sentiment direction.\n\n2. Assess Intensity Modifiers:\n   - Very positive sentiment is indicated by strong positive modifiers like \"hilarious,\" \"shamelessly enjoyed,\" \"the best,\" \"ingeniously,\" and \"very positive\" phrases.\n   - Very negative sentiment is indicated by strong negative modifiers like \"huge disappointment,\" \"big letdown,\" and \"bad and baffling.\"\n\n   Method: Look for intensifiers that amplify the sentiment, such as \"very,\" \"huge,\" \"big,\" or superlatives like \"the best.\"\n\n3. Consider Neutral Context:\n   - Neutral sentiment is often indicated by the absence of strong emotional words or by phrases that suggest indifference, such as \"mildly amusing,\" \"only,\" \"wants to,\" and \"thinking up grocery lists.\"\n\n   Method: Evaluate if the sentence lacks strong sentiment indicators or expresses a lack of engagement or interest.\n\n4. Evaluate Overall Sentence Meaning:\n   - Sometimes, the sentiment is not about individual words but the overall meaning of the sentence. For example, \"a huge disappointment coming from filmmakers of this calibre\" is very negative despite the positive connotation of \"filmmakers of this calibre.\"\n\n   Method: Read the entire sentence to understand the context and overall sentiment.\n\n5. Look for Contradictions or Irony:\n   - Sentences may contain contradictions or irony, which can affect sentiment classification. For example, \"surprisingly, the film is a hilarious adventure\" suggests a positive sentiment despite the initial negative expectation set by \"surprisingly.\"\n\n   Method: Identify if the sentence contains any unexpected turns or contrasts that could influence the sentiment.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences into very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative categories. Use examples from the provided list to illustrate each rule when necessary.",

Spot Keywords: Look for positive words (like \"best,\" \"fabulous\") or negative words (like \"bad,\" \"disappointment\") to gauge sentiment.\n\n2. Check Intensity: Notice words that strengthen sentiment, such as \"very\" or \"the best\" for strong positive or \"huge disappointment\" for strong negative feelings.\n\n3. Context Matters: If there's no strong emotional language or signs of indifference, the sentiment might be neutral. Consider the whole sentence's meaning and watch for contradictions or irony that could change the sentiment."
