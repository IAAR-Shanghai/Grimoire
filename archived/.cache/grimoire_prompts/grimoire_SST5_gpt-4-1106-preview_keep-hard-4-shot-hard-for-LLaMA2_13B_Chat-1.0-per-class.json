    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Positive or Negative Keywords:\n   - Positive: Words like \"fun,\" \"brilliant,\" \"smart,\" \"winner,\" \"witty.\"\n   - Negative: Words like \"uninteresting,\" \"mess,\" \"static,\" \"bitter,\" \"dull,\" \"cumbersome.\"\n   - Very Positive/Negative: Intensifiers like \"very,\" \"utterly,\" \"infinitely\" amplify sentiment.\n   - Example: \"brilliant\" suggests positive; \"utterly static\" suggests very negative.\n\n2. Consider Negations and Contrast Words:\n   - Negations: \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never\" can flip sentiment.\n   - Contrast: \"but,\" \"however,\" \"although\" may indicate a shift in sentiment.\n   - Example: \"not interesting\" becomes negative; \"fun but dull\" may be neutral or mixed.\n\n3. Evaluate Overall Sentiment of the Sentence:\n   - Sentiment is determined by the dominant tone.\n   - If both positive and negative elements are present, decide which is stronger.\n   - Example: \"laughable and compulsively watchable\" is more positive than negative.\n\n4. Contextual Clues and Subtleties:\n   - Sarcasm or irony may affect sentiment.\n   - Cultural references or specific domain knowledge might be needed.\n   - Example: \"a real winner\" is very positive, despite potential sarcasm.\n\n5. Apply the Rules Consistently:\n   - Use the identified keywords, negations, and overall sentiment to classify.\n   - Be consistent in how intensifiers and contrast words affect classification.\n   - Example: \"static picture\" is negative; \"utterly static picture\" is very negative.\n\nIn summary, classify sentiment by identifying keywords, considering negations and contrast, evaluating the overall sentiment, and being aware of contextual clues. Apply these rules consistently to determine if the sentiment is very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative.",

Look for key words that show feeling (like \"fun\" for positive or \"dull\" for negative) and intensifiers (like \"very\") that make them stronger.\n2. Watch for words that change the meaning (like \"not\" or \"but\") which can flip or mix the sentiment.\n3. Decide the main tone of the whole sentence, even if it has mixed feelings, and consider context like sarcasm. Use the rules the same way every time."
