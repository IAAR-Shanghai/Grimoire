    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Personal Opinions or Emotions**: Subjective statements often contain personal opinions, feelings, or emotions. Look for words that indicate a personal stance, belief, or emotional reaction.\n\n   - Example: \"I love this movie; it's the best I've ever seen!\" (Subjective - contains personal opinion and emotion)\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for adjectives or phrases that reflect personal judgment or emotional states.\n\n2. **Check for Factual Information**: Objective statements are based on facts and information that can be verified, without personal feelings or opinions.\n\n   - Example: \"The film was released in 1999 and directed by John Doe.\" (Objective - presents verifiable facts)\n   - Method: Evaluate if the sentence presents data or information that is not influenced by personal feelings.\n\n3. **Look for Impersonal Language**: Objective language is impersonal and does not refer to the speaker or their personal perspective.\n\n   - Example: \"The temperature dropped to -5 degrees Celsius overnight.\" (Objective - presents information without personal involvement)\n   - Method: Check if the sentence avoids personal pronouns or subjective adjectives.\n\n4. **Assess the Context**: Sometimes, the context of a sentence can help determine if it's subjective or objective. Consider the surrounding sentences and the overall tone of the text.\n\n   - Example: \"Many people believe that this policy is unfair.\" (Objective - reports on a belief held by others without taking a personal stance)\n   - Method: Look at the broader context to see if the sentence is part of a factual report or a personal narrative.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences as subjective or objective. Remember to focus on the presence of personal opinions versus factual information and the use of impersonal versus personal language.",

Look for personal opinions or emotions. Subjective sentences have words showing feelings or beliefs.\n2. Check if the sentence states facts that can be proven, which makes it objective.\n3. See if the language is impersonal, without \"I\" or \"my,\" which suggests it's objective.\n\nFocus on personal views vs. facts and personal vs. impersonal words."
