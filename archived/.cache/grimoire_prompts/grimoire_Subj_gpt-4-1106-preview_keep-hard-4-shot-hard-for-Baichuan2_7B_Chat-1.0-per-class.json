    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Factual Statements:\n   - Objective sentences typically present facts, descriptions, or events without personal feelings or opinions.\n   - Example: \"The main story involves an innocent teenage boy and a conniving teenage girl who meet on a beach one summer in southern Brazil.\"\n   - Method: Look for statements that describe who, what, where, or when without expressing personal emotions or judgments.\n\n2. Look for Opinion Indicators:\n   - Subjective sentences often contain words that indicate opinions, beliefs, or feelings (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"terrible,\" \"I think,\" \"I feel\").\n   - Since no examples of subjective sentences are provided, we'll focus on identifying the absence of these indicators to classify sentences as objective.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for adjectives or phrases that reflect personal perspective or emotional response. If none are found, the sentence is likely objective.\n\n3. Assess the Presence of Personal Pronouns:\n   - Subjective sentences may use first-person pronouns (\"I,\" \"we,\" \"my,\" \"our\") to express personal viewpoints.\n   - Method: Check for personal pronouns that suggest the author's personal involvement or opinion. Their absence usually points to an objective sentence.\n\n4. Determine the Intent of the Sentence:\n   - Objective sentences are intended to inform or report, while subjective sentences aim to persuade, express feelings, or share personal experiences.\n   - Method: Consider the purpose of the sentence. If it's to convey information without attempting to influence the reader's emotions or beliefs, it's objective.\n\nApplying these rules to the provided examples, we can see that all sentences are objective because they describe events or situations factually without expressing personal feelings or opinions.",
