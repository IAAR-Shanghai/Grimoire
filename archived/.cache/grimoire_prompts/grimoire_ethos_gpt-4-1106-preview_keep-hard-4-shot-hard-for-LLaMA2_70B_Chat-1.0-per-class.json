    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups or Individuals**: Determine if the sentence targets a specific group (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation) or individual with negative connotations.\n\n   - Example: \"kill the gays\" targets a sexual orientation group with a violent action.\n   - Method: Look for keywords that indicate a group or individual and assess the context for negativity.\n\n2. **Assess for Derogatory Language**: Check if the sentence contains derogatory terms, slurs, or language that is commonly associated with hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"why does that african american monkey hold gun like that?\" uses \"monkey\" as a derogatory term for a racial group.\n   - Method: Identify words that are pejorative or have historical usage in hate speech.\n\n3. **Evaluate Intent to Harm or Demean**: Consider if the sentence expresses an intent to cause harm, insult, or demean someone based on their identity.\n\n   - Example: \"I like big thick bitches to serve me my cocktail. They are good only for such things\" demeans a gender group by reducing them to objects for service.\n   - Method: Look for phrases that suggest harm, insult, or reduction of dignity.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Sarcasm**: Analyze the context to determine if the sentence is sarcastic or a joke, which might not be intended as hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Head looks like a big ass jelly bean\" may be a joke rather than hate speech.\n   - Method: Assess the tone and context for indicators of sarcasm or humor.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Hate and Criticism or Negative Opinion**: Recognize the difference between expressing a negative opinion or criticism and hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"because people become evil easily, it is in our genes\" is a general negative opinion about human nature, not targeted hate speech.\n   - Method: Determine if the negativity is directed at a specific group or is a broad statement without targeted hate.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on their content and context.",
