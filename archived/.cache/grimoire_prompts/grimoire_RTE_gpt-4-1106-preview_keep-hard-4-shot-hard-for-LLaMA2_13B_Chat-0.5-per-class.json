    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether a statement is true or false based on the provided information, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Direct Statement Verification**:\n   - *Rule*: Check if the statement is directly supported or contradicted by the information.\n   - *Method*: Look for keywords in the question that match the information given.\n   - *Example*: If the text says \"Herceptin was approved to treat breast cancer,\" and the question is \"Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer,\" the answer is True.\n\n2. **Implication and Inference**:\n   - *Rule*: Determine if the statement can be logically inferred from the information.\n   - *Method*: Understand the context and implied meaning, not just the literal words.\n   - *Example*: If the text mentions \"the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon,\" and the question is \"The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon,\" the answer is True, even though the text doesn't use the word \"previous.\"\n\n3. **Negation and Absence**:\n   - *Rule*: Identify if the statement is about the absence of something or a negation.\n   - *Method*: Look for words like \"no,\" \"not,\" \"never,\" and \"without.\"\n   - *Example*: If the text says \"No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet,\" and the question is \"Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq,\" the answer is False.\n\n4. **Misinterpretation or Misrepresentation**:\n   - *Rule*: Be cautious of statements that twist or misrepresent the information.\n   - *Method*: Compare the statement to the information to see if it changes the meaning.\n   - *Example*: If the text states \"Aristide killed a conference,\" and the question is \"Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered,\" the answer is False because \"killed a conference\" is a figure of speech and does not imply literal murder.\n\n5. **Geographical and Historical Facts**:\n   - *Rule*: Verify if the statement aligns with well-known geographical or historical facts.\n   - *Method*: Use general knowledge to assess the truthfulness of the statement.\n   - *Example*: If the text mentions \"Everglades National Park\" and the question is \"Everglades National Park is located in Florida,\" the answer is True based on common knowledge, even if the text doesn't explicitly say it's in Florida.\n\n6. **Specific Details and Dates**:\n   - *Rule*: Check for specific details like dates and names that must match exactly.\n   - *Method*: Look for exact matches in numbers, names, and dates.\n   - *Example*: If the text says \"GATT, in 1947,\" and the question is \"GATT was formed in 1947,\" the answer is True if it refers to the establishment date, but False if it refers to the rewriting of rules which happened later.\n\n7. **Current Events and Leadership Positions**:\n   - *Rule*: Confirm if the statement is about a current event or leadership position.\n   - *Method*: Determine if the information provided is about a recent change or current status.\n   - *Example*: If the text says \"Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader,\" and the question is \"Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church,\" the answer is True.\n\n8. **Arrests and Legal Actions**:\n   - *Rule*: Identify if the statement correctly describes legal actions or outcomes.\n   - *Method*: Look for information about arrests, detentions, and releases.\n   - *Example*: If the text says \"Bakri was released by police after being detained,\" and the question is \"Bakri was briefly detained, but was released,\" the answer is True.\n\nBy applying these rules and methods, you can accurately determine the truthfulness of statements based on the provided information.",
