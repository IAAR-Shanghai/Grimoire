    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Comprehension and Paraphrasing:**\n   - Understand the content of the statement and the question.\n   - Paraphrase the question to match the statement's information.\n   - Example: If the statement says \"68 civilians were killed and their funerals were held today in Baghdad,\" and the question asks if \"they were buried today in Baghdad,\" you can paraphrase the question to match the statement's information about the funerals being held.\n\n2. **Direct Correlation:**\n   - Identify if the question directly correlates with the information given.\n   - Apply by checking if the statement provides a clear answer to the question.\n   - Example: If the statement mentions \"pressure on French companies to end nuclear weapons testing,\" and the question is about \"international pressure to end French nuclear tests,\" there is a direct correlation.\n\n3. **Inference and Implication:**\n   - Determine if the question requires inference from the given information.\n   - Apply by inferring the logical conclusion from the statement.\n   - Example: If the statement talks about a hydroelectric project under construction, and the question asks if \"a hydroelectric project is proposed or is under construction,\" you can infer that the statement implies the project is indeed under construction.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Unstated Information:**\n   - Avoid assuming information not explicitly stated.\n   - Apply by strictly adhering to the information provided without adding assumptions.\n   - Example: If the statement does not mention the exact number of home runs by Babe Ruth, do not assume it matches the record number unless it is explicitly stated.\n\n5. **Historical and Factual Accuracy:**\n   - Check the statement against known historical or factual data.\n   - Apply by confirming if the statement aligns with historical records or facts.\n   - Example: If the statement gives a specific time frame for Victor Emmanuel's reign and the question's time frame does not match, the answer would be false based on historical accuracy.\n\n6. **Contextual Clues:**\n   - Use contextual clues to determine the truthfulness of the question.\n   - Apply by considering the context in which the information is presented.\n   - Example: If the context of a statement about a city's population after a disaster does not match the numbers or time frame in the question, the answer would be false.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can accurately determine the truthfulness of the questions based on the provided statements.",

Understand and rephrase the question to align with the statement's details.\n2. Check if the question clearly relates to the statement's information.\n3. Use the statement to logically deduce answers without adding extra assumptions."
