    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. Identify the Key Elements:\n   - Extract the main subjects, verbs, and objects from the statement and the question.\n   - Example: \"government troops sustained 11 casualties\" and \"inflicted three casualties on the rebels\" are key elements.\n\n2. Compare the Statement and the Question:\n   - Check if the information in the question directly matches or logically follows from the statement.\n   - Method: Look for synonyms, implications, or direct statements.\n   - Example: \"Three rebels were killed\" matches \"inflicted three casualties on the rebels.\"\n\n3. Consider the Context and Timeframe:\n   - Ensure the context and timeframe of the question align with the statement.\n   - Method: Identify time-related words like \"since,\" \"after,\" \"began,\" and check if they correspond.\n   - Example: \"In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action\" does not align with \"Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps.\"\n\n4. Analyze the Negatives:\n   - Pay attention to negative phrases in both the statement and the question.\n   - Method: Look for words like \"not,\" \"denied,\" \"without,\" \"no longer,\" and ensure their presence or absence is consistent.\n   - Example: \"Oil prices fall back\" contradicts \"Oil prices rise.\"\n\n5. Check for Specific Locations or Names:\n   - Verify if locations or names mentioned in the question are specified in the statement.\n   - Method: Match proper nouns and geographical locations.\n   - Example: \"Everglades National Park is located in Florida\" is not mentioned in the statement about \"Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties.\"\n\nBy applying these rules, you can determine the truthfulness of the questions based on the provided statements.",
