    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Keywords**: Look for words that typically convey emotion, such as \"love\" for positive or \"hate\" for negative sentiments.\n\n   - Example: \"I love this product!\" would be very positive due to the presence of \"love.\"\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for emotionally charged words.\n\n2. **Consider Intensifiers**: Words that amplify the sentiment, like \"very\" or \"extremely,\" can push a positive or negative sentiment to very positive or very negative.\n\n   - Example: \"I am very happy with the service.\" would be very positive because \"very\" intensifies the positive word \"happy.\"\n   - Method: Look for adverbs that increase the sentiment's strength.\n\n3. **Evaluate Negations**: Words like \"not\" can reverse the sentiment of a word or phrase.\n\n   - Example: \"I am not happy with this product.\" would be negative because \"not\" negates the positive word \"happy.\"\n   - Method: Identify negations and assess their impact on nearby keywords.\n\n4. **Contextual Meaning**: Sometimes, the sentiment is not about the presence of specific words but how they are used together.\n\n   - Example: \"This is nothing special.\" might be considered neutral or slightly negative, depending on the context.\n   - Method: Read the full sentence to understand the overall sentiment.\n\n5. **Neutral Statements**: Sentences that state facts without any emotional words are usually neutral.\n\n   - Example: \"The package arrived on Monday.\" is neutral as it simply states a fact without emotion.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is just conveying information.\n\n6. **Sarcasm or Irony**: Be aware that sarcasm or irony can invert the sentiment.\n\n   - Example: \"Oh great, another meeting.\" might be negative if said sarcastically, despite the positive word \"great.\"\n   - Method: Consider the tone and context to detect sarcasm or irony.\n\nRemember to keep the analysis concise and focused on these rules for efficient sentiment classification.",

Look for emotional words (like \"love\" or \"hate\") and intensifiers (like \"very\") to determine if a sentence is positive or negative and how strong the sentiment is.\n2. Check for negations (like \"not\") that can flip the sentiment.\n3. Read the whole sentence to understand context, including sarcasm, and to spot neutral statements that just share facts."
