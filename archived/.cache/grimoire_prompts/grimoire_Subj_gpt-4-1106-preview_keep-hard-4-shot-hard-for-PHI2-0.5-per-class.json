    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Factual Statements:\n   - Objective sentences typically present facts, descriptions, or statements that do not contain personal feelings, opinions, or emotions.\n   - Example: \"The main story involves an innocent teenage boy and a conniving teenage girl who meet on a beach one summer in southern Brazil.\"\n   - Method: Look for sentences that describe events, characters, or settings without expressing personal thoughts or emotions.\n\n2. Look for Opinion Indicators:\n   - Subjective sentences often include words that indicate opinions, beliefs, or personal feelings, such as \"beautiful,\" \"terrible,\" \"exciting,\" etc.\n   - Since no examples of subjective sentences are provided, we'll focus on identifying the absence of these indicators to classify sentences as objective.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for adjectives or adverbs that reflect personal judgment or emotional responses. Their absence usually points to an objective statement.\n\n3. Assess the Context:\n   - Objective sentences can also be identified by their context, such as being part of a synopsis, a factual report, or a historical account.\n   - Example: \"Michael Rooker plays a guard, Fisher Stevens, John Seda, and Master P co-star.\"\n   - Method: Consider the sentence in the context of its source. If it's from a source that aims to inform or describe without bias, it's likely objective.\n\n4. Avoid Lengthy Explanations:\n   - Keep the rules concise and to the point, providing clear examples and methods for application without unnecessary detail.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences as subjective or objective. Remember to focus on the presence of factual information and the absence of personal opinions or emotions to determine objectivity.",
