    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the topic of a sentence into World, Sports, Business, or Technology, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Sports**: Look for keywords related to sports names, athletes, sports teams, competitions, and scores. Example: \"United Need to Be in Ruud Health\" mentions \"Manchester United,\" a sports team, indicating the Sports category.\n\n   *Method*: Identify sports-related terms and associate them with the Sports category.\n\n2. **Business**: Identify sentences that discuss financial matters, companies, markets, or economic terms. Example: \"Martha wants to go to jail now\" mentions \"Martha Stewart\" and \"stock trade,\" which are related to Business.\n\n   *Method*: Look for business-related vocabulary and associate it with the Business category.\n\n3. **World**: Sentences that refer to global news, countries, international events, or geopolitical issues fall under World. Example: \"Nepal shocked by hostage murders\" discusses an international incident, placing it in the World category.\n\n   *Method*: Detect references to international events or locations and classify them as World.\n\n4. **Technology**: Sentences that mention technological advancements, electronics, scientific research, or IT companies are classified as Technology. Example: \"Sun expands pay-as-you-go supercomputing\" contains tech-related terms like \"supercomputing,\" indicating the Technology category.\n\n   *Method*: Identify technology-specific terms and concepts and categorize them under Technology.\n\n**Note**: The last example provided, \"Study Says Birds Feed Other Birds' Young,\" does not fit the Technology category based on the content. It seems to be a misclassification and should likely be categorized under World or a different relevant category such as Science or Environment, if available. Always ensure the content matches the category based on the context and not just isolated keywords.",
