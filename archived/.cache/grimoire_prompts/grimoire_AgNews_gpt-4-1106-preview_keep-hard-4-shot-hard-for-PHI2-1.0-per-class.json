    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRule 1: Identify Key Terms\n- Look for specific words that are commonly associated with the four categories.\n- Example: \"inflation,\" \"government,\" \"president,\" \"diversity\" suggest a World topic.\n- Method: Scan the sentence for these keywords and match them to the related category.\n\nRule 2: Recognize Contextual Clues\n- Consider the broader context of the sentence, such as the location or entities involved.\n- Example: \"UEFA Cup,\" \"Test series,\" \"baseball stadium\" indicate Sports.\n- Method: Understand the context in which the keywords are used to determine the category.\n\nRule 3: Understand Industry-Specific Language\n- Identify terms that are specific to business, technology, or sports industries.\n- Example: \"profits,\" \"fine,\" \"market's close\" are Business; \"IPod,\" \"IT services,\" \"database\" are Technology.\n- Method: Match industry-specific language to the corresponding category.\n\nRule 4: Analyze Sentence Structure\n- Look at the structure of the sentence for hints about the topic.\n- Example: Sentences structured around financial results, corporate actions, or market activities often relate to Business.\n- Method: Evaluate how the sentence is constructed to help classify the topic.\n\nRule 5: Use Process of Elimination\n- If a sentence doesn't clearly fit one category, eliminate categories that it definitely isn't related to.\n- Example: If a sentence doesn't mention sports events, teams, or athletes, it's likely not Sports.\n- Method: Narrow down the options by discarding the least likely categories.\n\nApply these rules by scanning each sentence for keywords, understanding the context, recognizing industry language, analyzing the structure, and using the process of elimination to classify the topic into World, Sports, Business, or Technology.",
