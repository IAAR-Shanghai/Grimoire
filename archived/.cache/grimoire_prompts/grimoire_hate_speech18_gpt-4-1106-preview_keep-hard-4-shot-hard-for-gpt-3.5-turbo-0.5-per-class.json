    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. Identify Discriminatory Language:\n   - Look for words or phrases that target a group based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other social categories.\n   - Example: \"mr whitey would be branded a big bad evil racist\" targets a racial group.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for keywords that indicate bias or stereotypes.\n\n2. Assess Context for Negative Stereotypes:\n   - Determine if the sentence perpetuates negative stereotypes or expresses contempt.\n   - Example: \"the little shops were all white runned and owned\" implies a negative change related to racial demographics.\n   - Method: Consider the overall message and whether it implies harm or negativity towards a specific group.\n\n3. Look for Generalizations or Assumptions:\n   - Check if the sentence makes broad generalizations about a group.\n   - Example: \"reds are just SO naive\" makes a sweeping assumption about a group.\n   - Method: Identify phrases that suggest all members of a group share a negative trait.\n\n4. Evaluate Tone and Intent:\n   - Consider if the sentence has an aggressive or hostile tone.\n   - Example: \"South Africa has returned to the Stone Age in 20 years\" uses a derogatory comparison.\n   - Method: Read the sentence for emotional cues that suggest hate or aggression.\n\n5. Distinguish Between Hate and Criticism:\n   - Differentiate between sentences that express hate and those that offer criticism without targeting a group.\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting\" criticizes a policy, not a group.\n   - Method: Focus on whether the criticism is directed at actions/ideas or at people/groups.\n\n6. Consider Historical and Social Context:\n   - Be aware of historical and social connotations that may influence the interpretation of the sentence.\n   - Example: \"Sinners of the past did including your own people who sold you like cattle\" references history without expressing hate.\n   - Method: Use knowledge of social and historical contexts to inform your judgment.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, identifying any elements that match the criteria for hate speech, and using your judgment to classify the sentence accordingly. Remember to keep the analysis concise and focused on the key elements that indicate hate speech.",
