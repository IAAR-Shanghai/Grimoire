    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Sentiments or Aggression:**\n   - If a sentence expresses negative sentiments or aggression towards a group based on their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc., it is likely to be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Christians are all demonic\" shows aggression towards Christians, so it is classified as \"hate.\"\n\n2. **Look for Inclusive or Positive Statements:**\n   - Sentences that express support, love, or respect for all people, regardless of their identity, are classified as \"no hate.\"\n   - Example: \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone...\" is an inclusive statement, so it is classified as \"no hate.\"\n\n3. **Assess Context and Sarcasm:**\n   - Context matters; a sentence may seem negative but could be sarcastic or ironic. Assess the overall message.\n   - Example: \"I love deaf people. I can scream on them and I can scold them\" seems sarcastic and disrespectful, so it is classified as \"hate.\"\n\n4. **Distinguish Between Hate Speech and Non-targeted Statements:**\n   - Sentences that do not target a specific group or do not contain harmful intentions are classified as \"no hate.\"\n   - Example: \"T-Rex mated with a donkey\" is a nonsensical statement without targeted hate, so it is classified as \"no hate.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate Calls to Action:**\n   - Sentences that call for violence or harm against a group are classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"TERRORISTS ARE NOT ISLAMIC... KILL THOSE TERRORISTS...\" calls for violence and is classified as \"hate.\"\n\nApply these rules by reading each sentence carefully, considering the tone, context, and the presence of any targeted negative sentiments or calls to action. If the sentence promotes inclusivity or lacks targeted aggression, classify it as \"no hate.\" If it contains negative sentiments or calls for harm against a specific group, classify it as \"hate.\"",
