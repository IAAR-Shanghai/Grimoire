    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Factual Statements:\n   - Objective sentences typically present facts, descriptions, or information without personal feelings or opinions.\n   - Example: \"The sky is blue.\" (Objective - it states a fact)\n   - Method: Look for statements that can be verified or are widely accepted as true.\n\n2. Look for Opinion Indicators:\n   - Subjective sentences express personal feelings, beliefs, or opinions.\n   - Example: \"I think the sky is the most beautiful shade of blue.\" (Subjective - it expresses a personal belief)\n   - Method: Check for words like \"I think,\" \"I feel,\" \"I believe,\" or any other phrases that indicate a personal stance.\n\n3. Assess Emotional Language:\n   - Subjective sentences often contain emotional language or dramatic adjectives.\n   - Example: \"The breathtaking sky captivated everyone's hearts.\" (Subjective - uses emotional language)\n   - Method: Identify emotionally charged words or phrases that reflect the speaker's attitude.\n\n4. Determine the Presence of Bias:\n   - Subjective sentences may show bias or partiality towards a particular view or opinion.\n   - Example: \"The sky's blue hue is clearly superior to all other colors.\" (Subjective - shows bias)\n   - Method: Look for language that suggests the speaker is favoring one side or perspective over another.\n\n5. Check for Reporting Verbs:\n   - Objective sentences might use reporting verbs to convey information without personal input.\n   - Example: \"The report states that the sky is blue.\" (Objective - uses a reporting verb)\n   - Method: Identify verbs that are used to report information, such as \"states,\" \"reports,\" \"shows,\" etc.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences as subjective or objective. Remember that objective sentences are about facts and information, while subjective sentences involve personal feelings, opinions, or biases.",
