    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Key Words: Look for words that typically convey sentiment, such as adjectives and adverbs. Positive sentiments often include words like \"perfect,\" \"respect,\" \"laughable,\" and \"good,\" while negative sentiments include words like \"cumbersome,\" \"letdown,\" \"disappointment,\" and \"uninteresting.\"\n\n   Example: \"cumbersome\" suggests a negative sentiment.\n   Method: Scan the sentence for sentiment-laden words.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers: Words that intensify the sentiment, such as \"very,\" \"so,\" \"quite,\" and \"big,\" can shift a positive or negative sentiment to very positive or very negative.\n\n   Example: \"very disappointing\" suggests a very negative sentiment.\n   Method: Look for intensifiers near key sentiment words.\n\n3. Evaluate Context: Sentiment can be affected by the context in which words are used. Phrases like \"no clear picture\" or \"only mildly amusing\" may indicate a neutral sentiment, as they suggest a lack of strong feeling.\n\n   Example: \"only mildly amusing\" suggests a neutral sentiment.\n   Method: Assess the overall context of the sentiment words.\n\n4. Look for Negations: Words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"n't,\" and \"without\" can negate or reverse the sentiment of the words that follow.\n\n   Example: \"isn't good\" suggests a negative sentiment.\n   Method: Identify negations and interpret their impact on sentiment.\n\n5. Analyze Comparative Phrases: Phrases that compare or set expectations, such as \"could have been so much more\" or \"a huge disappointment coming from,\" often indicate a negative sentiment, as they imply that something fell short of expectations.\n\n   Example: \"a huge disappointment coming from\" suggests a very negative sentiment.\n   Method: Detect comparative phrases and evaluate their sentiment implications.\n\n6. Consider Sarcasm or Irony: Sometimes, positive words are used in a way that conveys a negative sentiment (sarcasm) or vice versa. This can be challenging and may require understanding subtleties in language.\n\n   Example: \"laughable and compulsively watchable\" could be positive if taken literally, but context may imply sarcasm.\n   Method: Use context clues to determine if sarcasm or irony is present.\n\n7. Assess Overall Tone: The sentiment of a sentence is often conveyed through the overall tone, which can be determined by the combination of words and phrases used.\n\n   Example: \"fun and nimble\" suggests a very positive sentiment.\n   Method: Read the entire sentence to gauge the general tone.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences into very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative categories.",
