    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify the Core Statement**: Extract the main fact or claim from the question. For example, \"Portugal joined the war on Britain's side\" is the core statement in the first example.\n\n2. **Match the Core Statement with the Given Information**: Compare the core statement with the provided information to see if they align. For example, if the question says \"Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side,\" and the core statement is that Portugal joined on Britain's side, they match, so the answer is True.\n\n3. **Check for Direct Relevance**: Ensure the information directly addresses the question. For example, the question about the number of children dying is not directly answered by the statement about zinc deficiency, but if you know that zinc deficiency can lead to death, you can infer a True answer.\n\n4. **Avoid Assumptions**: Do not make assumptions beyond the information given. For example, the question about martial law in a colony is not directly confirmed by the statement about driving the British out of Boston, so the answer is False.\n\n5. **Understand Context**: Recognize when the information is about a specific case that doesn't apply generally. For example, the ability to grow a plant from a leaf doesn't mean a plant won't suffer if it loses roots or shoots in general, so the answer is False.\n\n6. **Identify Specifics**: Look for specific names, terms, or details that must match. For example, if the question asks about a manifesto named \"Ele Divrei HaBerit\" and the information doesn't confirm that Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger produced it, the answer is False.\n\n7. **Avoid Misleading Connections**: Just because two pieces of information are related doesn't mean one confirms the other. For example, discussing \"diaphragming\" in music doesn't confirm who developed the Dynagroove format, so the answer is False.\n\n8. **General Knowledge Verification**: Use general knowledge when necessary. For example, knowing the population of the British Isles is not given in the statement about the geography of the islands, so the answer is False.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading both the question and the provided information, then use critical thinking to determine if the statement is True or False based on the alignment and relevance of the facts.",
