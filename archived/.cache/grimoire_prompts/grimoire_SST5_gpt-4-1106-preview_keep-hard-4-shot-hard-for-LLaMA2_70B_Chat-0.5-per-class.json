    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Key Words: Look for words that typically convey sentiment, such as \"disappointment,\" \"brilliant,\" \"cumbersome,\" or \"fun.\" Positive words suggest a positive sentiment, while negative words suggest a negative sentiment.\n\n   - Example: \"brilliant\" in \"has created a brilliant motion picture\" suggests a very positive sentiment.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for emotionally charged words and determine their usual connotation.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers: Words like \"very,\" \"so,\" \"totally,\" or \"big\" can amplify the sentiment of the key words.\n\n   - Example: \"a big letdown\" is more intense than just \"a letdown,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n   - Method: Look for intensifiers near key sentiment words and adjust the sentiment strength accordingly.\n\n3. Evaluate Overall Meaning: Some sentences may contain both positive and negative elements. Determine the dominant sentiment based on the overall meaning.\n\n   - Example: \"entertaining enough, but nothing new\" has a slight negative sentiment due to the expectation of novelty not being met.\n   - Method: Weigh the positive and negative aspects to decide the overall sentiment.\n\n4. Contextual Clues: Sometimes the sentiment is not about the words, but the context they are used in.\n\n   - Example: \"it's uninteresting\" lacks strong negative words, but the context implies a very negative sentiment.\n   - Method: Consider the sentence's implication and the context in which words are used.\n\n5. Neutral Statements: Sentences that state facts without any emotional words are usually neutral.\n\n   - Example: \"there's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane\" is a factual statement without sentiment.\n   - Method: If there are no sentiment-inducing words and the sentence is purely informational, classify it as neutral.\n\nRemember to keep the analysis concise and focused on the sentiment conveyed by the sentence as a whole, considering both the individual words and the context in which they appear.",
