    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\n   - Extract the main subjects, verbs, and objects from both the statement and the question.\n   - Example: \"No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.\" vs. \"Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.\"\n   - Method: Compare the key elements to see if they match or contradict.\n\n2. **Understand Context:**\n   - Pay attention to the context in which the information is presented.\n   - Example: \"Aristide killed a conference\" vs. \"Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered.\"\n   - Method: Recognize that \"killing a conference\" is metaphorical and does not imply a literal killing.\n\n3. **Check for Specificity and Generalization:**\n   - Determine if the question generalizes or specifies information from the statement.\n   - Example: \"Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients\" vs. \"Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.\"\n   - Method: If the statement is more specific than the question, the answer can still be true if the general case is implied.\n\n4. **Analyze Implications:**\n   - Infer logical implications from the given statement.\n   - Example: \"Valero Energy Corp. found additional damage at its refinery\" implies production capability, not actual production.\n   - Method: Use logical reasoning to deduce if the statement implies the information in the question.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Creation and Attribution:**\n   - Identify if the subject is credited with creating or simply associated with something.\n   - Example: \"Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's 'Little Red Book'\" vs. \"Lin Piao wrote the 'Little Red Book'.\"\n   - Method: Understand that being a creator can include compiling or editing, not just authoring.\n\n6. **Interpret Numeric and Qualitative Data:**\n   - Compare numerical values and qualitative descriptions accurately.\n   - Example: \"U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel\" vs. \"Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.\"\n   - Method: Ensure that the numerical data and its description in the question match the statement.\n\n7. **Use Geographic Knowledge:**\n   - Apply general knowledge about locations when necessary.\n   - Example: \"Everglades National Park is located in Florida\" is a general knowledge fact.\n   - Method: If the question requires geographic knowledge not provided in the statement, use common knowledge to answer.\n\nKeep the explanations concise and apply each rule methodically to determine if the statement supports the question's claim, resulting in a True or False answer.",
    "simple_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\n1. Identify the main points: Look for the main subjects, actions, and objects in the information and compare them to see if they match or differ.\n2. Understand the context and implications: Consider the context and what's implied, not just the literal meaning. Recognize if the information is a general case or a specific instance.\n3. Check facts and logic: Make sure numbers and facts are consistent and use logical reasoning to deduce if the information supports the claim. Use common knowledge when needed."
