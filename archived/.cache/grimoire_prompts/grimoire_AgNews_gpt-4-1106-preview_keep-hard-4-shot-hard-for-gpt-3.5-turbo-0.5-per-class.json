Identify Key Words:\n   - World: Look for words related to international affairs, countries, global events, or political figures.\n   - Sports: Look for names of sports, athletes, sports teams, or sports events.\n   - Business: Look for words related to finance, companies, markets, or economic activities.\n   - Technology: Look for words related to gadgets, software, companies in the tech industry, or technological advancements.\n\n   Example: \"IBM expands into Danish IT services market\" contains \"IBM\" (a tech company) and \"IT services\" (technology-related), indicating Technology.\n\n2. Contextual Understanding:\n   - World: Sentences discussing geopolitical issues, international relations, or global crises.\n   - Sports: Sentences discussing sports results, team movements, or athlete careers.\n   - Business: Sentences discussing financial results, market strategies, or business decisions.\n   - Technology: Sentences discussing new devices, software updates, or tech industry trends.\n\n   Example: \"Nervous Cubans swap Yankee dollars for pesos\" discusses an economic activity, indicating Business.\n\n3.
