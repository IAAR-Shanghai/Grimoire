    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Derogatory Language or Stereotypes**: Sentences that contain derogatory terms, racial slurs, or reinforce negative stereotypes about a group of people based on race, ethnicity, or other characteristics should be classified as \"hate.\"\n\n   - Example: \"The majority of them are as stupid as real Negroes.\"\n   - Method: Look for words or phrases that are commonly understood to be offensive or that generalize a group in a negative way.\n\n2. **Assess Intent to Demean or Dehumanize**: If the sentence seems to intentionally demean or dehumanize an individual or group, it is likely \"hate.\"\n\n   - Example: \"As the saying goes, you can take the ape out of the jungle, but you can't take the jungle out of the ape.\"\n   - Method: Consider whether the language used is meant to belittle or reduce the humanity of the subject.\n\n3. **Check for Implicit Bias or Prejudice**: Sometimes, sentences may not have explicit slurs but may imply a bias or prejudice. This can also be classified as \"hate.\"\n\n   - Example: \"Here is possibly the best county to live in when one considers the Mud Index.\"\n   - Method: Look for coded language or euphemisms that are used to avoid direct slurs but still convey a prejudiced message.\n\n4. **Distinguish Between Hate Speech and Criticism**: Not all negative statements are hate speech. Criticism of actions, policies, or ideas, without attacking a group or individual based on inherent characteristics, is not \"hate.\"\n\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting.\"\n   - Method: Focus on whether the criticism is directed at behavior or ideas rather than personal or group identity.\n\n5. **Consider Context and Common Expressions**: Some sentences may include phrases that are historically or culturally loaded with hate, even if they don't seem immediately offensive.\n\n   - Example: \"South Africa has returned to the Stone Age in 20 years.\"\n   - Method: Evaluate the historical and cultural implications of the phrases used.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on the presence of derogatory language, intent to demean, implicit bias, and the distinction between hate speech and criticism, while considering the broader context.",
