    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Sentiments or Aggression:**\n   - If a sentence expresses negative sentiments or aggression towards a group or individual based on their identity (race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc.), it is likely to be classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"I love deaf people. I can scream on them and I can scold them\" shows aggression towards deaf individuals, so it is classified as hate.\n\n2. **Look for Generalizations or Stereotypes:**\n   - Sentences that contain harmful generalizations or stereotypes about a group of people are classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"Every female-dominated job: low skill; minimal education required; not much physical exertion; indoors; tightly controlled hours.\" This is a stereotype about jobs dominated by women, so it is classified as hate.\n\n3. **Assess Intent and Context:**\n   - Sometimes, the intent behind a sentence can indicate hate. If the sentence seems to be promoting harm or discrimination, it is hate.\n   - Example: \"Abortion is a solution for autism\" suggests a harmful action towards individuals with autism, so it is classified as hate.\n\n4. **Distinguish Between Hate and Blunt Remarks:**\n   - Not all blunt or rude remarks are classified as hate. If the comment is not targeting a person or group based on their identity, it may not be hate.\n   - Example: \"Head looks like a big ass jelly bean\" is a blunt remark but not targeting an identity group, so it is classified as no hate.\n\n5. **Consider Advocacy and Support Statements:**\n   - Statements that advocate for equality or support marginalized groups, even if expressed strongly, are not classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone...\" is a supportive statement for the LGBTQ+ community, so it is classified as no hate.\n\n6. **Evaluate Threats and Calls for Violence:**\n   - Any sentence that includes threats or calls for violence against a specific group or individual is classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"TERRORISTS ARE NOT ISLAMIC... KILL THOSE TERRORISTS...\" includes a call for violence and is classified as hate.\n\n7. **Misunderstanding or Lack of Context:**\n   - If a sentence could be misunderstood or lacks context, consider the most likely interpretation based on common social norms.\n   - Example: \"Anyone who can't cope as the gender they are born needs SERIOUS psychological therapy!!!\" may seem like a blunt opinion, but it is targeting individuals based on gender identity and suggesting they are mentally ill, which can be classified as hate.\n\nApply these rules by reading each sentence carefully, considering the context, and using your best judgment to determine if the sentence is promoting hate or not.",
