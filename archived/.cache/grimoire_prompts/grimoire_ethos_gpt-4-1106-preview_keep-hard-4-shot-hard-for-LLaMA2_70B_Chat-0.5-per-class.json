    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups or Individuals**: Look for mentions of specific groups (e.g., race, religion, gender, sexual orientation) or individuals that could be targeted by hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"why does that african american monkey hold gun like that?\" targets a racial group.\n   - Method: Scan for keywords related to identity groups and assess if they are used pejoratively.\n\n2. **Assess Intent to Harm or Demean**: Determine if the sentence expresses an intent to cause harm, insult, or demean someone based on their identity.\n\n   - Example: \"kill the gays\" clearly shows intent to harm a group based on sexual orientation.\n   - Method: Look for violent language, insults, or derogatory terms that suggest harm or contempt.\n\n3. **Check for Incitement of Violence**: Identify any calls to action that incite violence or discrimination against a group or individual.\n\n   - Example: \"TERRORISTS ARE NOT ISLAMIC... KILL THOSE TERRORISTS...\" incites violence.\n   - Method: Look for imperatives or commands that suggest taking harmful action.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Tone**: Evaluate the overall context and tone of the sentence. Sarcasm, jokes, or satire might sometimes mask hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"I love deaf people. I can scream on them and I can scold them\" uses sarcasm to demean a group.\n   - Method: Analyze the sentence for sarcasm, irony, or mocking tone that could indicate a hateful message.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Hate and Non-Hate**: Not all negative or critical statements are hate speech. Assess whether the criticism is constructive or simply an expression of dislike without targeting an identity.\n\n   - Example: \"Head looks like a big ass jelly bean\" is an insult but does not target a protected characteristic.\n   - Method: Determine if the negative statement is general or specifically aimed at an identity group.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on their content, intent, and context.",
