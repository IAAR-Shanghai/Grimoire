    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Key Words and Phrases:\n   - Positive sentiment: Words like \"entertaining,\" \"uplifting,\" \"funny,\" \"inspired,\" \"best,\" \"exquisite,\" \"inventive,\" \"mesmerizing,\" \"tenderness,\" \"laughs.\"\n   - Negative sentiment: Words like \"flat,\" \"flailing,\" \"recycled,\" \"uncanny,\" \"flat,\" \"uncreative,\" \"bilking,\" \"rigid,\" \"evasive.\"\n   - Neutral sentiment: Phrases that are factual or lack strong emotional language, such as \"he gets his secretary to fax it.\"\n\n   Method: Scan the sentence for emotionally charged words or phrases. Positive and negative words will often directly influence the sentiment.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers and Diminishers:\n   - Very Positive/Negative: Look for intensifiers that amplify the sentiment, such as \"very,\" \"exquisite,\" \"best,\" \"bilked,\" \"rigid.\"\n   - Positive/Negative: Absence of intensifiers or presence of diminishers may indicate a less strong sentiment.\n\n   Method: Assess the degree of sentiment based on the presence of words that intensify or diminish the emotional impact.\n\n3. Analyze Overall Sentence Structure and Tone:\n   - Sentences with mixed sentiments or sarcasm might require deeper analysis to determine the prevailing sentiment.\n   - Sentences that present facts or neutral descriptions without clear emotional language are likely neutral.\n\n   Method: Read the entire sentence to understand the context and the tone, which can affect the sentiment classification.\n\n4. Look for Conjunctions and Contrast:\n   - Phrases with \"but\" or similar conjunctions may indicate a contrast, often leading to a mixed or negative sentiment.\n\n   Method: Identify conjunctions that introduce contrast and determine how they affect the sentiment of the sentence.\n\n5. Evaluate the Context:\n   - Some sentences may require knowledge of the context, such as cultural references or specific events, to accurately classify sentiment.\n\n   Method: Use background knowledge or research to understand the context if the sentiment is not clear from the sentence alone.\n\nExamples:\n- \"The film aims to be funny, uplifting and moving\" contains positive words like \"funny,\" \"uplifting,\" and \"moving,\" indicating a positive sentiment.\n- \"Beneath the uncanny, inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade...\" includes negative words like \"uncanny\" and a negative phrase \"beneath the facade,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n- \"He gets his secretary to fax it\" lacks emotional language, indicating a neutral sentiment.\n\nRemember to keep the analysis concise and focused on the sentiment conveyed by the language used in the sentence.",

Look for emotional words: Positive words (e.g., \"best,\" \"funny\") suggest positive sentiment; negative words (e.g., \"flat,\" \"rigid\") suggest negative sentiment; factual phrases suggest neutrality.\n\n2. Check for modifiers: Words like \"very\" can strengthen sentiment; their absence or opposite words can weaken it.\n\n3. Understand context and tone: Consider the whole sentence and context for mixed sentiments or neutrality, especially with sarcasm or cultural references."
