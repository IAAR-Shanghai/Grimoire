    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Sentiments or Aggression:**\n   - If a sentence expresses negative sentiments or aggression towards a group based on their identity (e.g., race, gender, disability), it is likely hate.\n   - Example: \"I can scream on them and I can scold them\" shows aggression towards deaf people.\n   - Method: Look for words or phrases that convey hostility, ridicule, or disrespect.\n\n2. **Check for Stereotyping or Degradation:**\n   - Sentences that stereotype or degrade individuals or groups are classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"though they are degraded anyways\" implies a belief in the inferiority of a gender.\n   - Method: Identify generalizations or demeaning language about a group's characteristics or behaviors.\n\n3. **Assess Intent to Harm or Exclude:**\n   - Statements with the intent to harm, exclude, or deny rights to a group are hate.\n   - Example: \"male to female shall be banned\" suggests exclusion and denial of rights.\n   - Method: Evaluate if the sentence advocates for actions or policies that would harm or limit a group.\n\n4. **Distinguish Between Hate and Absurdity:**\n   - Absurd or nonsensical statements without a clear target of hate are not classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"T-Rex mated with a donkey\" is nonsensical and lacks a hateful message.\n   - Method: Use context to determine if the statement is meant to be taken seriously or is simply absurd.\n\n5. **Recognize Affirmation or Support:**\n   - Sentences that affirm or support equality and respect for all are not hate.\n   - Example: \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone.\" promotes inclusivity.\n   - Method: Look for positive affirmations of love, respect, and acceptance.\n\n6. **Personal Pride Without Disparagement:**\n   - Expressing pride in one's identity is not hate, provided it does not disparage others.\n   - Example: \"I'm white, I'm proud to be white, I love diversity\" is a non-hateful expression of self-pride alongside a positive view of diversity.\n   - Method: Ensure that expressions of self-pride are not coupled with negative comparisons or derogatory remarks about others.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, identifying key phrases or words that trigger the rules, and using the context to determine the overall message. If the sentence violates any of the criteria for hate, classify it as such; otherwise, classify it as no hate.",
