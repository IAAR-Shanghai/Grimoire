    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these summarized rules:\n\n1. **Identify Trigger Words**: Look for explicit slurs, derogatory terms, or phrases commonly associated with hate speech. For example, racial slurs or sexist terms are strong indicators of hate speech.\n\n   *Method*: Scan the sentence for known trigger words. Maintain a list of such words for reference.\n\n2. **Assess Context**: Sometimes, words or phrases can be hateful in one context but not in another. Consider the overall message of the sentence.\n\n   *Method*: Read the full sentence to understand the speaker's intent. Look for indicators of sarcasm, quotes, or a discussion about hate speech, which might not be hate speech itself.\n\n3. **Check for Targeted Groups**: Hate speech often targets a specific group based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc.\n\n   *Method*: Identify if the sentence is directed at a particular group in a negative manner.\n\n4. **Analyze Tone and Aggression**: A hateful sentence often carries an aggressive or demeaning tone.\n\n   *Method*: Look for words that convey aggression or are meant to belittle or intimidate.\n\n5. **Consider Threats or Incitement**: Statements that include threats of violence or incite hatred or discrimination are classified as hate speech.\n\n   *Method*: Identify any call to action that promotes harm or discrimination against individuals or groups.\n\n6. **Use Reliable Tools**: When in doubt, use AI tools or databases that are designed to detect hate speech, but always review their suggestions critically.\n\n   *Method*: Run the sentence through a detection tool, then manually review the result for accuracy.\n\nRemember, the context is key, and some sentences may require a nuanced understanding of language and cultural references to classify correctly.",
