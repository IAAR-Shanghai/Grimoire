Abbreviation:\n   - If the sentence asks about the meaning or stands for a series of letters or a shortened form of a word, classify it as Abbreviation.\n   - Example: \"What does 'NASA' stand for?\" would be Abbreviation.\n   - Method: Look for phrases like \"What does ... mean?\" or \"stand for\" followed by an acronym or initialism.\n\n2. Entity:\n   - If the sentence inquires about a non-living thing, concept, or object, classify it as Entity.\n   - Example: \"What is the hardest substance in the human body?\" would be Entity.\n   - Method: Identify if the subject of the sentence is an inanimate object or concept.\n\n3. Description:\n   - If the sentence seeks information about the significance, history, or explanation of something, classify it as Description.\n   - Example: \"What is the history of 'the toast'?\" would be Description.\n   - Method: Look for questions about the meaning, background, or explanation of an event, object, or tradition.\n\n4. Person:\n   - If the sentence is about a specific individual or a role occupied by a person, classify it as Person.\n   - Example: \"Who invented the telephone?\" would be Person.\n   - Method: Identify if the question is about a person's identity, role, or relationship.\n\n5. Location:\n   - If the sentence asks about a geographical place or a physical location, classify it as Location.\n   - Example: \"Where is the Eiffel Tower located?\" would be Location.\n   - Method: Determine if the question pertains to a place's name, position, or geographical information.\n\n6. Number:\n   - If the sentence is looking for a numerical value, date, distance, or quantity, classify it as Number.\n   - Example: \"How many countries are in Europe?\" would be Number.\n   - Method: Identify if the question requires a numerical answer, including measurements, counts, or dates.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, identifying key phrases or words that indicate the category, and matching the sentence to the corresponding rule.",
