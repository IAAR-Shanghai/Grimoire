    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Factual Statements**: Objective sentences typically present facts or information without personal feelings, opinions, or bias. Look for sentences that describe events, characters, or settings in a neutral way.\n\n   - Example: \"The main story involves an innocent teenage boy and a conniving teenage girl who meet on a beach one summer in southern Brazil.\"\n   - Method: Check if the sentence states information without expressing personal feelings or opinions. If it does, classify it as objective.\n\n2. **Detect Personal Opinions or Emotions**: Subjective sentences express personal feelings, opinions, or beliefs. They often contain adjectives or verbs that reflect personal judgment.\n\n   - Example: \"The movie was incredibly boring and a waste of time.\"\n   - Method: Look for words that indicate a personal viewpoint or emotional response. If present, classify the sentence as subjective.\n\n3. **Assess the Presence of Bias**: Sentences that show a preference, prejudice, or bias towards a particular idea or person are subjective.\n\n   - Example: \"The brilliant performance by the lead actor truly elevated the film.\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence leans towards a positive or negative judgment that is not universally acknowledged as fact. If it does, classify it as subjective.\n\n4. **Check for Generalizations or Assumptions**: Subjective sentences may include generalizations or assumptions that are not backed by evidence.\n\n   - Example: \"All politicians are corrupt and cannot be trusted.\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence makes a broad claim without supporting evidence. If so, classify it as subjective.\n\nRemember to keep the explanation concise and focus on identifying key indicators of subjective or objective language. Apply these rules consistently to classify the sentiment of sentences accurately.",

Look for just the facts: If a sentence gives information without personal feelings, it's objective.\n2. Spot personal views: If a sentence shows personal feelings or opinions, it's subjective.\n3. Check for bias or general claims without proof: If a sentence shows bias or makes unsupported general claims, it's subjective."
