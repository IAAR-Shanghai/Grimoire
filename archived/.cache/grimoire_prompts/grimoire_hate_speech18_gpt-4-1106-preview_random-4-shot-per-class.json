    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups or Individuals**: Look for references to specific groups or individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other identity markers. Examples include \"filthy jews\" or \"magic negro.\"\n\n   *Method*: Scan the sentence for keywords that indicate a group or individual is being targeted. If such words are present, consider the context to determine if they are used pejoratively.\n\n2. **Assess the Tone and Intent**: Determine if the sentence has a derogatory, hostile, or demeaning tone towards the group or individual identified.\n\n   *Method*: Read the sentence to gauge the emotional tone. Look for adjectives, adverbs, and verbs that convey negativity or hostility.\n\n3. **Check for Generalizations and Stereotypes**: Sentences that make sweeping negative generalizations or stereotypes about a group are likely to be classified as hate.\n\n   *Method*: Look for statements that attribute negative characteristics or behaviors to an entire group rather than individuals.\n\n4. **Evaluate Contextual Clues**: Sometimes, the context can shift a sentence from hate to no hate. For example, historical references or discussions without negative intent may not be classified as hate.\n\n   *Method*: Consider the broader context of the sentence. If the sentence is part of a historical discussion or lacks negative intent, it may not be classified as hate.\n\n5. **Consider the Presence of Threats or Calls to Action**: Sentences that contain threats or calls to action against a group or individual are indicative of hate.\n\n   *Method*: Look for verbs that suggest action or harm directed at a group or individual.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate.\" Remember that the context is crucial, and some sentences may require a nuanced understanding of language and intent.",
