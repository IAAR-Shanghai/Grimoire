    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of outputting \"True\" or \"False\" in response to a question, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: Determine if the question is a statement of fact or a logical condition that can be evaluated as true or false. For example, \"Is the sky blue?\" can be evaluated based on the common understanding that the sky is blue during a clear day.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Statement**: Apply relevant knowledge or information to assess the truthfulness of the statement. If the question is \"Is 2+2 equal to 4?\", you apply simple arithmetic to confirm that the statement is true.\n\n3. **Conditional Logic**: If the question involves a conditional statement (e.g., \"If it is raining, is the ground wet?\"), evaluate the condition and the outcome. If the condition is met and the outcome logically follows, the answer is true.\n\n4. **Fact-Checking**: For questions based on factual information, verify the facts from reliable sources before determining the truth value. For instance, if asked \"Is Paris the capital of France?\", check a trustworthy source to confirm that Paris is indeed the capital.\n\n5. **Avoiding Assumptions**: Do not make assumptions about ambiguous questions. If the question lacks clarity or context, it may not be possible to provide a true or false answer without additional information.\n\n6. **Consistency with Established Facts**: Ensure that the answer is consistent with widely accepted facts or established knowledge. If a question contradicts known facts, the answer should be false.\n\nRemember to keep the explanation concise and directly related to the method of determining the truth value of the question presented.",
