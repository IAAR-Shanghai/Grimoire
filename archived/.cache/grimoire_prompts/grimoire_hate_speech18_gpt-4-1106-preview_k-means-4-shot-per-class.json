    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups or Individuals:**\n   - Look for mentions of specific groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, etc.\n   - Example: \"This disgusting negro...\" targets an individual based on race.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for keywords that indicate a group or individual is being singled out.\n\n2. **Assess Negative Language or Sentiments:**\n   - Determine if the sentence contains derogatory terms, insults, or negative stereotypes.\n   - Example: \"...makes us (white people) look bad.\" uses a derogatory term and casts a negative stereotype.\n   - Method: Evaluate the adjectives and verbs used for negative connotations.\n\n3. **Check for Exclusionary or Threatening Language:**\n   - Look for language that suggests exclusion, superiority, or threats towards a group.\n   - Example: \"...vile hordes invading our lands...\" implies a threat and exclusion.\n   - Method: Identify phrases that suggest conflict, invasion, or dehumanization.\n\n4. **Analyze Context for Subtle Hate:**\n   - Sometimes hate is not overt; check for subtle implications or dog whistles.\n   - Example: \"No need to allow FACTS to get in the way of a good White guilt message!\" implies a subtle attack on a group.\n   - Method: Consider the broader context and potential implications of the sentence.\n\n5. **Determine the Overall Message:**\n   - Evaluate if the sentence's overall message is meant to harm, demean, or incite negativity towards a group.\n   - Example: \"That's their real contribution to society, misery and dependence.\" suggests a harmful stereotype.\n   - Method: Summarize the sentence's intent and check if it aligns with promoting hate.\n\nIf a sentence meets any of the criteria for negative language, targeted attacks, or exclusionary sentiments towards a group or individual, classify it as \"hate.\" Otherwise, classify it as \"no hate.\"",
