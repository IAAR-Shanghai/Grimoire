    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: Determine if the statement in the question can be directly inferred from the given text.\n   - Example: If the text says \"Everglades National Park celebrated its 50th anniversary,\" and the question asks if the park is in Florida, you cannot infer the location from the anniversary statement alone.\n   - Method: Read the text and question carefully to see if the answer is explicitly stated or logically implied.\n\n2. **Fact-Checking**: Verify if the statement is a fact that can be checked independently of the text.\n   - Example: If the question is \"GATT was formed in 1947,\" check if the text provides information about the formation of GATT.\n   - Method: Look for specific dates, names, or events in the text that confirm or deny the fact.\n\n3. **Relevance and Specificity**: Ensure the question is relevant to the information provided and is not about general knowledge.\n   - Example: If the text discusses a Norwegian newspaper corpus and the question asks about a specific newspaper, the answer cannot be determined unless that specific newspaper is mentioned in the text.\n   - Method: Focus on the specific details mentioned in the text and disregard general knowledge.\n\n4. **Logical Deduction**: Use logical reasoning to deduce the answer when direct information is not available.\n   - Example: If the text states \"Jakarta was called Batavia until 1949,\" and the question is about Jakarta being the capital of Indonesia, you cannot deduce this from the historical name alone.\n   - Method: Apply logic to the information given, but do not assume facts not presented in the text.\n\n5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Do not assume information that is not stated or implied in the text.\n   - Example: If the text mentions a refinery's damage and its production capacity, do not assume the production figure is related to the damage unless explicitly stated.\n   - Method: Stick to the information given without making additional assumptions.\n\n6. **Direct Confirmation**: If the text directly confirms or denies the statement, use that as the basis for the answer.\n   - Example: If the text says \"Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church,\" and the question confirms this role, the answer is True.\n   - Method: Look for direct statements in the text that answer the question.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading the text, understanding the context, checking facts within the text, using logical reasoning, avoiding assumptions, and looking for direct confirmations or denials.",
