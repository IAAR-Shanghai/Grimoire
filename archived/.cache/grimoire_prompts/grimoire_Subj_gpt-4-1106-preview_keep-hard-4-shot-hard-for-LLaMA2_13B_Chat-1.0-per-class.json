    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Subjective Language:\n   - Subjective sentences often contain opinions, feelings, beliefs, desires, or speculations.\n   - Example: \"I love this movie because it's the best I've ever seen.\"\n   - Method: Look for words that indicate personal opinion or emotion.\n\n2. Identify Objective Language:\n   - Objective sentences state facts, provide information, or describe events without personal bias.\n   - Example: \"The film was released in 1999 and directed by John Doe.\"\n   - Method: Check for factual statements and absence of personal pronouns or emotional words.\n\n3. Analyze Sentence Structure:\n   - Subjective sentences may use first-person pronouns (\"I,\" \"we\") or adjectives that reflect personal judgment.\n   - Objective sentences often focus on the subject matter and avoid personal pronouns.\n   - Method: Review the sentence for pronouns and adjectives that indicate subjectivity.\n\n4. Context Matters:\n   - Sometimes, the context of a sentence can help determine if it's subjective or objective.\n   - Example: \"The cake is delicious.\" (subjective if it's a personal opinion, objective if it's a widely accepted fact)\n   - Method: Consider the broader context in which the sentence appears.\n\n5. Look for Reporting Verbs:\n   - Objective sentences may use verbs that indicate an action or occurrence without personal input.\n   - Example: \"The report states that the economy is growing.\"\n   - Method: Identify verbs that convey information without implying personal thoughts or feelings.\n\nApply these rules by examining each sentence, looking for indicators of subjectivity or objectivity, and classifying the sentiment accordingly. Keep the analysis concise and focused on the presence of factual information versus personal opinion.",
