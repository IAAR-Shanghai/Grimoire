    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into \"Hate\" or \"No Hate\":\n\n1. Identify Hate Speech:\n   - Hate speech typically targets a person or group based on attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.\n   - Example: \"I hate all [group name] people, they should all be expelled from our country.\"\n   - Method: Look for derogatory terms, calls for violence, or expressions of intolerance towards specific groups.\n\n2. Context Matters:\n   - Sometimes, words that might seem hateful can be used in a non-hateful context.\n   - Example: \"I don't like this band's music\" is not hate speech, but \"I don't like people from [country]\" could be.\n   - Method: Consider the sentence as a whole and the context in which words are used.\n\n3. Distinguish Between Opinion and Hate:\n   - Expressing a negative opinion about a policy or an action is not necessarily hate speech.\n   - Example: \"I think this new law is unfair\" is an opinion, not hate speech.\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence is critiquing a behavior, action, or policy rather than attacking a group.\n\n4. Look for Intent to Harm or Exclude:\n   - Hate speech often includes an element of harm or exclusion towards the targeted group.\n   - Example: \"All [group name] should be banned from this profession\" is hate speech.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence promotes exclusion, harm, or discrimination.\n\n5. Assess the Use of Stereotypes or Slurs:\n   - The use of stereotypes or slurs can indicate hate speech.\n   - Example: Using a racial slur to describe someone is hate speech.\n   - Method: Be alert for words that are commonly recognized as slurs or stereotypes.\n\n6. Consider the Presence of Threats or Incitement:\n   - Sentences that contain threats or incite violence or hatred are classified as hate speech.\n   - Example: \"Someone should teach those [group name] a lesson\" could be hate speech if it implies violence.\n   - Method: Look for language suggesting physical harm or encouraging others to hate or act against a group.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, understanding the context, and using the methods described to determine if the sentence is \"hate\" or \"no hate.\" If a sentence does not meet any of the criteria for hate speech, it should be classified as \"no hate.\"",

Check for Targeted Hate: If a sentence attacks a group based on race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., it's likely hate speech.\n\n2. Context is Key: Words might seem hateful but check the full context to see if they're used in a non-hateful way.\n\n3. Opinion vs. Hate: Criticizing a policy or action isn't hate speech; attacking a group is. Look for intent to harm or exclude, use of slurs, or threats."
