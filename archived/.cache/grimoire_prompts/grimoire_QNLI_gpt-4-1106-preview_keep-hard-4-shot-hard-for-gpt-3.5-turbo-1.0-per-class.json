    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether the provided statements are true or false, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Comprehension**: Understand the context of the question and the statement given. This involves identifying the key elements of the question and the statement.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about crime rates in a specific year and the statement mentions the same year and location with corresponding data, you can deduce the truthfulness.\n   - *Method*: Read the question and statement carefully, noting dates, locations, percentages, and other specific details.\n\n2. **Comparison**: Compare the information in the question with the information in the statement to see if they match or contradict each other.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about the average service time for men as missionaries and the statement provides the exact duration, compare the two.\n   - *Method*: Look for direct correlations between the question's subject and the statement's information.\n\n3. **Contradiction Detection**: Identify any contradictions between the question and the statement. If the statement directly contradicts the information in the question, the answer is false.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question implies that a plant cannot survive without roots or shoots, but the statement suggests it can grow from a single leaf or cell, this is a contradiction.\n   - *Method*: Check for opposing facts or claims between the question and the statement.\n\n4. **Inference**: Sometimes, the truthfulness can be inferred from what is implied by the statement, even if not directly stated.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about the affiliation of Mexico City with the nation of Mexico and the statement talks about constitutional clauses preventing it from becoming a state, infer the relationship.\n   - *Method*: Read between the lines to understand the implications of the statement.\n\n5. **Fact-Checking**: Use your general knowledge or external sources to verify facts if necessary. However, the task seems to be designed to be solvable with the information provided.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question is about the definition of federalism and the statement describes the advocacy of a strong central government, use your understanding of federalism to assess truthfulness.\n   - *Method*: Apply your knowledge of the subject matter to evaluate the statement's accuracy.\n\nRemember to keep your answers concise and focused on the rules applied.",
