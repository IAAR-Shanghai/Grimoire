    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence as subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Personal Opinions or Emotions**: If the sentence expresses personal feelings, beliefs, or opinions, it is likely subjective. Look for words that indicate emotions (e.g., happy, sad) or judgment (e.g., beautiful, terrible).\n\n   - Example: \"I love this movie, it's the best I've ever seen.\"\n   - Method: The sentence contains personal emotions (\"love\") and judgment (\"best\"), indicating it is subjective.\n\n2. **Check for Factual Statements**: If the sentence states facts or information without personal bias or emotion, it is likely objective.\n\n   - Example: \"The Earth orbits around the Sun.\"\n   - Method: The sentence presents a fact without any personal emotion or opinion, so it is objective.\n\n3. **Look for Impersonal Phrasing**: Objective sentences often use impersonal language and do not refer to the speaker or their feelings.\n\n   - Example: \"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.\"\n   - Method: The sentence uses impersonal language to describe a scientific fact, making it objective.\n\n4. **Assess the Context**: Sometimes, the context of the sentence can help determine if it's subjective or objective. If it's part of a larger argument or narrative with personal views, it may be subjective.\n\n   - Example: \"In my experience, early birds are more successful.\"\n   - Method: The context (\"In my experience\") indicates that the statement is based on personal views, so it is subjective.\n\n5. **Determine the Purpose**: Consider the purpose of the sentence. If it's meant to inform or report, it's likely objective. If it's meant to persuade or express feelings, it's likely subjective.\n\n   - Example: \"Studies show that regular exercise improves health.\"\n   - Method: The purpose is to inform based on studies, which suggests an objective statement.\n\nBy applying these rules and methods to the given sentences, you can classify them as subjective or objective. Remember that the presence of factual information typically indicates objectivity, while personal opinions or emotions suggest subjectivity.",

Check if it's a fact: Sentences with just facts, no bias or emotion, are objective.\n3. Is it impersonal? If it doesn't mention personal feelings or the speaker, it's likely objective."
