    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentiment as Subjective or Objective:\n\n1. Identify Factual Statements:\n   - Objective sentences typically present facts or information without personal feelings or opinions.\n   - Example: \"The main story involves an innocent teenage boy and a conniving teenage girl who meet on a beach one summer in southern Brazil.\"\n   - Method: Look for statements that describe events, characters, or settings without expressing personal thoughts or emotions.\n\n2. Look for Opinion Indicators:\n   - Subjective sentences often contain words that indicate opinions, beliefs, or feelings (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"terrible,\" \"I think,\" \"I feel\").\n   - Example: Not provided in the task, but a subjective sentence might be: \"The movie's portrayal of the teenage boy was incredibly touching and masterful.\"\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for adjectives or phrases that reflect personal judgment or emotional responses.\n\n3. Assess the Presence of Bias:\n   - Subjective sentences may show a bias or preference, while objective sentences maintain neutrality.\n   - Example: Not provided in the task, but a subjective sentence might be: \"The conniving teenage girl was the best character due to her complex personality.\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence leans towards a particular viewpoint or remains impartial.\n\n4. Check for Verifiable Information:\n   - Objective sentences contain information that can be verified or observed by others.\n   - Example: \"Trouble comes when Tom's ex-girlfriend reappears, asking for help, announcing him that she had a girl from him 9 years ago.\"\n   - Method: Consider if the details in the sentence can be checked for accuracy or are widely accepted as true.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences as subjective or objective. Remember that the task requires identifying the sentiment of the sentence, so focus on distinguishing between factual descriptions (objective) and personal opinions or emotions (subjective).",
