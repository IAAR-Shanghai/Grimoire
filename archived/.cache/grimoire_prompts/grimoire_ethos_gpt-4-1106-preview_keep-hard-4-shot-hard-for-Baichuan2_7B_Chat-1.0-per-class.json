    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Hate Speech**: Hate speech typically targets a person or group based on characteristics such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. Look for derogatory language, slurs, or aggressive tones aimed at these groups.\n\n   - Example: \"I hate [group] and all they stand for.\"\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for negative words directly associated with a group's characteristics.\n\n2. **Assess Tone and Context**: Sometimes, sentences may contain words that could be considered hateful out of context. Assess the tone and the context to determine the intent.\n\n   - Example: \"I'm white, I'm proud to be white, I love diversity and people of all nations.... lets move on. :)\" (No hate, as the sentence promotes diversity and positivity.)\n   - Method: Look for additional information in the sentence that clarifies the intent.\n\n3. **Look for Statements of Harm or Violence**: Expressions of a desire to harm others, especially based on their group identity, are often classified as hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"I'd love to see [group] suffer.\"\n   - Method: Identify verbs or phrases that suggest physical or emotional harm.\n\n4. **Consider Supportive or Neutral Statements**: Sentences that express support, love, or neutral opinions without targeting any group negatively are typically not hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Much love to you, thank you for your courage. Keep speaking your truth\" (No hate, as it's supportive.)\n   - Method: Identify positive affirmations or neutral comments that do not contain harmful or derogatory content.\n\n5. **Evaluate Humor or Sarcasm**: Sometimes, what might seem like hate speech could be an attempt at humor or sarcasm. This can be subjective and tricky to assess.\n\n   - Example: \"Head looks like a big ass jelly bean\" (No hate, as it's likely an attempt at humor rather than a targeted attack.)\n   - Method: Consider the possibility of humor or sarcasm, but err on the side of caution if the intent is unclear.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" with a focus on the content's intent, context, and impact.",
