    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject Matter**: Determine the main subject of the statement and the question. For example, in the first example, the subject is the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Grenada.\n\n2. **Check for Specific Details**: Look for specific names, places, events, or technologies mentioned in both the statement and the question. For instance, in the second example, the specific detail is the docking of the Atlantis with the ISS, not Mir.\n\n3. **Understand the Context**: Grasp the context in which the statement is made. This includes understanding the broader situation or the specific industry or field being discussed. For example, in the third example, the context is the shipping industry, not the automotive industry.\n\n4. **Compare and Contrast**: Compare the information in the statement with the question to see if they match or if there is a contradiction. For example, in the fourth example, the statement offers a Balinese massage as an option, but the question's claim about the technique is not supported by the statement.\n\n5. **Apply Logic and General Knowledge**: Use logical reasoning and your own general knowledge to infer if the question's statement is likely to be true or false based on the information provided. For example, in the seventh example, general knowledge about particle physics confirms the truth of the statement regarding the top quark.\n\n6. **Look for Direct Confirmation or Refutation**: Find a direct statement that confirms or refutes the question. For instance, in the fifth example, the statement directly confirms that the funerals were held in Baghdad.\n\n7. **Assess the Language Used**: Pay attention to the language and phrasing. If the question uses language not present in the statement, it may indicate a false answer. For example, in the first example, the statement does not mention the U.S. military, so the answer is false.\n\nApplying the Rules:\n\n- Read the statement carefully and identify the key elements.\n- Read the question and pinpoint the specific detail or claim it makes.\n- Compare the question's claim with the statement's information.\n- Use logical reasoning and your general knowledge if necessary.\n- Decide if the question's claim is directly supported (True) or not (False) by the statement.\n\nKeep the explanation concise and focused on the method of determining the truthfulness of the question's claim based on the provided statement.",
