    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether a statement is true or false based on the provided information, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\n   - Extract the main subjects, verbs, and objects from both the statement and the question.\n   - Example: \"Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.\" Key information: Valero Energy Corp., produces, 250,000 barrels per day.\n\n2. **Compare Information:**\n   - Match the key information from the question with the information in the statement.\n   - Method: Look for direct matches, synonyms, or implications that connect the question to the statement.\n   - Example: The statement says Valero found damage at a refinery that processes 250,000 barrels per day. The question asks if Valero produces that amount. The implication is that if they have a refinery with that capacity, they produce that amount.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding:**\n   - Understand the context of the information provided.\n   - Method: Consider the broader scenario presented in the statement to interpret the question correctly.\n   - Example: The Bundesbank's opposition to the euro implies that there was resistance to its introduction.\n\n4. **Temporal Relevance:**\n   - Pay attention to the time frame mentioned in the statement and the question.\n   - Method: Check if the time frames match or if there is a clear chronological connection.\n   - Example: The statement about Brazil's actions to reduce deforestation starts in 1987, so a question about the early 1990s is false because it falls within the stated time frame.\n\n5. **Logical Inference:**\n   - Use logical reasoning to infer the truthfulness of the question based on the statement.\n   - Method: If the statement does not directly answer the question, infer the answer using logic and context.\n   - Example: If the statement discusses the sale of Talisman's holdings announced by Al Gore, it does not provide information about the location of Everglades National Park, so the answer is false.\n\n6. **Avoid Assumptions:**\n   - Do not assume information that is not explicitly stated or logically inferred from the statement.\n   - Method: Stick to the information given without adding personal knowledge or assumptions.\n   - Example: The statement about bacteria and antibiotics does not claim that bacteria are winning, only that they can mutate and resist therapy, so the answer is false.\n\nApply these rules systematically to each question to determine whether the answer is true or false.",
