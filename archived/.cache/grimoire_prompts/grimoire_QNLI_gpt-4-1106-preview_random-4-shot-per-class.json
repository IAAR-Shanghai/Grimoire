    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. Identify the Subject and Predicate:\n   - Determine the main subject and action or state described in the question.\n   - Example: In \"Who did Sprague work for early in his career?\", the subject is \"Sprague\" and the predicate is \"work for early in his career\".\n\n2. Cross-reference Information:\n   - Check the statement provided against the question to see if it directly answers the question or provides relevant information.\n   - Method: Compare the key elements of the question with the information in the statement to see if they match or contradict.\n\n3. True or False Criteria:\n   - If the statement directly answers the question or supports the information asked in the question, the answer is True.\n   - If the statement does not answer the question, provides unrelated information, or contradicts the information asked in the question, the answer is False.\n   - Example: For \"How many copies of On the Origin of Species were created in the first printing?\", the statement provides the exact number of copies and date, which directly answers the question, so the answer is True.\n\n4. Avoid Assumptions:\n   - Do not infer or assume information not explicitly stated in the question or the provided statement.\n   - Example: The question about the British Isles asks about population, but the statement only describes the geographical composition, so the answer is False.\n\n5. Contextual Clues:\n   - Pay attention to specific dates, names, places, or events that can confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement.\n   - Method: Look for these clues in both the question and the statement to guide your True or False determination.\n\nKeep the explanations concise and focused on the method of applying each rule to ensure the summary is not too long.",
