Look for words or phrases that attack a group's identity (race, gender, etc.). If found, it's \"hate.\"\n2. Check if the sentence unfairly stereotypes or generalizes a group negatively. If yes, it's \"hate.\"\n3. Use common sense to tell apart hate speech from simple disagreement. If it's not targeting a group's identity, it's \"no hate.\""
