    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether the provided statements are true or false based on the given information, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\n   - Extract the main subject and predicate from both the question and the provided statement.\n   - Example: For \"When did the Olympic torch visit Jakarta?\" identify \"Olympic torch\" and \"visit Jakarta\" as key subjects and \"April 22\" as the predicate.\n\n2. **Compare Information:**\n   - Match the key information from the question with the provided statement.\n   - Example: Match \"Olympic torch\" and \"visit Jakarta\" from the question with \"The Olympic flame reached Jakarta on April 22\" from the statement.\n\n3. **Check for Direct Correlation:**\n   - Determine if the provided statement directly answers the question.\n   - Example: Since the statement confirms the Olympic torch reached Jakarta on April 22, it directly correlates with the question.\n\n4. **Assess Contextual Relevance:**\n   - Ensure the context of the provided statement is relevant to the question.\n   - Example: If the question is about the ethnicity of the Bronx population, a statement about Asian Americans does not directly answer a question about Hispanic and Latino Americans.\n\n5. **Evaluate for Logical Connection:**\n   - Use logical reasoning to infer if the statement implies a true or false answer to the question.\n   - Example: If the question is about the danger of avian flu to humans and the statement mentions the potential for a pandemic, there is a logical connection that implies a true answer.\n\n6. **Avoid Assumptions:**\n   - Do not infer or assume information not explicitly stated.\n   - Example: A question about Schwarzenegger's private jet purchase cannot be answered with information about his net worth after a divorce unless the cost of the jet is mentioned.\n\n7. **Answer with True or False:**\n   - Based on the comparison and evaluation, answer \"True\" if the statement confirms the question, or \"False\" if it does not.\n   - Example: If the statement \"The Olympic flame reached Jakarta on April 22\" is given in response to the question \"When did the Olympic torch visit Jakarta?\" the answer is \"True\".\n\nApply these rules methodically to each question and statement pair to determine the correct True or False answer.",

Find and match the main points in both the question and the statement.\n2. Ensure the statement directly and contextually answers the question.\n3. Use logic without assuming unstated information to decide if the answer is True or False."
