    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether the provided statements are true or false, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: Read the given statement and the question carefully to understand what is being asked.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question is \"What is the meaning of federalism?\" and the statement talks about \"federalists\" advocating for a strong central government, you need to understand that federalism is a system that combines a general government with regional governments in a single political system, not just a strong central government.\n\n   - *Method*: Break down the statement into key components and ensure you understand the terms and context.\n\n2. **Fact-Checking**: Compare the statement with the question to see if the information directly answers the question or if it contains factual inaccuracies.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about the increase in crime in St. John's in 2009 and the statement says it increased by 4%, check if this matches known data or the context provided.\n\n   - *Method*: Use your knowledge or available resources to verify the accuracy of the statement.\n\n3. **Contextual Alignment**: Ensure the statement is relevant to the question and that it does not contain irrelevant or misleading information.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question is about what happens if a plant loses roots or shoots, and the statement talks about growing plants from a single leaf or cell, this does not directly answer the question about the loss of roots or shoots.\n\n   - *Method*: Assess whether the statement directly addresses the question without introducing unrelated information.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Check if the statement logically follows from the question and if it makes sense within the context provided.\n\n   - *Example*: If the question asks about the league the Montreal Expos are in, and the statement correctly identifies them as part of the National League, it is logically consistent.\n\n   - *Method*: Apply logical reasoning to determine if the statement is a logical answer to the question.\n\n5. **Answer Determination**: After evaluating the statement using the above rules, decide if the statement is true or false in relation to the question.\n\n   - *Method*: If the statement passes the fact-checking, is contextually aligned, and is logically consistent, the answer is likely true. If it fails any of these checks, the answer is likely false.\n\nRemember to keep your analysis concise and focused on these rules to efficiently determine the truthfulness of each statement.",
