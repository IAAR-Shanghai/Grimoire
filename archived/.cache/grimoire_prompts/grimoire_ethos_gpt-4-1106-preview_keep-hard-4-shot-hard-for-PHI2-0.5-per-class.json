    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Sentiments or Aggression:**\n   - **Rule:** Look for words or phrases that express negativity, hostility, or aggression towards individuals or groups.\n   - **Example:** \"I can scream on them and I can scold them\" shows negativity towards deaf people.\n   - **Application:** If such language is present, lean towards classifying as \"hate.\"\n\n2. **Assess for Derogatory Language or Insults:**\n   - **Rule:** Check if the sentence contains slurs, insults, or derogatory terms aimed at a person or group.\n   - **Example:** \"Abortions at 30 years old mentally handicapped\" uses derogatory language.\n   - **Application:** Presence of derogatory language typically indicates \"hate.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate Context and Intent:**\n   - **Rule:** Consider the broader context and the intent behind the words. Sometimes sarcasm or irony might be used, which can affect classification.\n   - **Example:** \"TERRORISTS ARE NOT ISLAMIC... THEY ARE SATANIC\" shows intent to insult a group.\n   - **Application:** Determine if the intent is to harm or demean; if so, classify as \"hate.\"\n\n4. **Look for Affirmative or Supportive Language:**\n   - **Rule:** Identify sentences that express support, love, or positivity towards others.\n   - **Example:** \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone.\" is an expression of support.\n   - **Application:** If the sentence is supportive and positive, classify as \"no hate.\"\n\n5. **Consider Statements of Fact or Opinion Without Hostility:**\n   - **Rule:** Distinguish between neutral statements of fact or opinion and those that carry a hateful tone.\n   - **Example:** \"Islam and Christianity have mixed for centuries\" is a neutral statement.\n   - **Application:** If the statement is factual or opinion-based without hostility, classify as \"no hate.\"\n\n6. **Use Common Sense and Social Awareness:**\n   - **Rule:** Apply general knowledge and social norms to interpret ambiguous sentences.\n   - **Example:** \"T-Rex mated with a donkey\" is nonsensical and not directed at any group.\n   - **Application:** If the sentence doesn't target anyone and isn't hostile, classify as \"no hate.\"\n\nRemember, context is key, and some sentences may require careful consideration of the nuances in language and intent.",
