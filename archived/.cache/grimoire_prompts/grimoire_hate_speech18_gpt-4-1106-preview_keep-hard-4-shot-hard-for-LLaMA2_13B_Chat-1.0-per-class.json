    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. **Identify Discriminatory Language:**\n   - Rule: If a sentence contains language that discriminates based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or any other social group, it is classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"So sick of the way its working, I remember when I was growing up in Winnipeg the little shops were all white runned and owned...\" suggests nostalgia for a racially homogeneous business community, implying discrimination.\n   - Method: Look for words or phrases that indicate a preference for or against a particular group based on inherent characteristics.\n\n2. **Detect Generalizations and Stereotypes:**\n   - Rule: Sentences that generalize a group of people negatively or use stereotypes are classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"As the saying goes, you can take the ape out of the jungle, but you can't take the jungle out of the ape.\" uses a derogatory stereotype.\n   - Method: Identify phrases that attribute a characteristic to an entire group in a derogatory manner.\n\n3. **Assess Context for Sarcasm or Irony:**\n   - Rule: If a sentence uses sarcasm or irony to demean a group, it is classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"reds are just SO naive!\" may use sarcasm to express contempt for a political group.\n   - Method: Look for words in all caps or context that indicates a sarcastic tone.\n\n4. **Evaluate Intent and Impact:**\n   - Rule: If the intent of the sentence is to belittle, intimidate, or incite violence against a group, it is classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"South Africa has returned to the Stone Age in 20 years.\" implies a derogatory view of a country's progress.\n   - Method: Consider the potential impact of the sentence on the targeted group and whether it promotes hostility.\n\n5. **Look for Absence of Hate Indicators:**\n   - Rule: If none of the above indicators are present, the sentence is likely classified as no hate.\n   - Example: \"We have to fight for our survival and our future but we can have our cake and eat it too.\" does not contain discriminatory language or negative generalizations.\n   - Method: Confirm the sentence does not contain hate speech elements before classifying it as no hate.\n\nRemember to apply these rules with sensitivity to context and cultural nuances. The classification can sometimes be subjective, and borderline cases may require careful consideration.",

If sarcasm or irony is used to demean a group, it's hate speech.
