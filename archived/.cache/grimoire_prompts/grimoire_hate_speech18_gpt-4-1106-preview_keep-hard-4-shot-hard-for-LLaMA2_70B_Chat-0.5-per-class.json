    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into \"Hate\" or \"No Hate\":\n\n1. **Identify Discriminatory Language:**\n   - Rule: If a sentence contains language that discriminates based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or any other protected characteristic, classify it as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"mr whitey would be branded a big bad evil racist\" contains discriminatory language against a racial group.\n   - Method: Look for keywords or phrases that indicate bias or stereotypes.\n\n2. **Assess Context for Negative Stereotypes:**\n   - Rule: If a sentence perpetuates negative stereotypes or derogatory assumptions about a group, classify it as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"you can take the ape out of the jungle, but you can't take the jungle out of the ape\" uses a negative stereotype.\n   - Method: Evaluate the sentence for implied negative generalizations about a group.\n\n3. **Check for Implicit Bias:**\n   - Rule: Sentences that imply inferiority or superiority of one group over another, even if not explicit, should be classified as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"South Africa has returned to the Stone Age in 20 years\" implies a regression attributed to the people.\n   - Method: Look for insinuations or indirect references that suggest bias.\n\n4. **Distinguish Between Criticism and Hate:**\n   - Rule: Criticism of policies, actions, or ideas without targeting a specific group is not \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting\" criticizes a policy, not a group.\n   - Method: Focus on whether the criticism is directed at a group or at a non-personal entity or idea.\n\n5. **Evaluate Tone and Intent:**\n   - Rule: A sentence that expresses frustration or dissatisfaction in a general context, without targeting a group, is \"no hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Probably be a good idea to call your kid's teachers\" is a suggestion without hate.\n   - Method: Assess the tone for aggression or malice towards a specific group.\n\n6. **Consider Historical and Cultural References:**\n   - Rule: References to historical oppression or derogatory terms, even if not overtly aggressive, classify as \"hate.\"\n   - Example: \"Sinners of the past did including your own people who sold you like cattle\" alludes to historical events without hate.\n   - Method: Be aware of the historical and cultural connotations of phrases used.\n\nApply these rules by carefully reading each sentence, identifying any of the above elements, and classifying the sentence accordingly. Remember that context is key, and some sentences may require a nuanced understanding of language and intent.",

If a sentence has language that discriminates or stereotypes based on identity (like race or gender), label it as \"hate.\"\n2. Criticism of ideas or policies isn't \"hate\" unless it targets a specific group.\n3. Sentences with historical or cultural slurs are \"hate,\" even if not directly aggressive."
