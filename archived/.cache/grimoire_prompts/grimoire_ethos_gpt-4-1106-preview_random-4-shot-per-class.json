    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence as \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Hate Speech**: Hate speech typically targets a group based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability. Look for derogatory language, threats, or negative stereotypes.\n\n   - Example: \"Abortion is a solution for autism\" implies a negative stereotype about individuals with autism, classifying it as hate.\n\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for words or phrases that demean or advocate violence against a specific group.\n\n2. **Assess Context and Tone**: Sometimes, a sentence may contain words that are often associated with hate speech, but the context or tone indicates it's not meant to be hateful.\n\n   - Example: \"IM GAY AND FUCKING PROUD FUCK BITCHES LIKE THESE PEOPLE\" uses strong language but is a statement of self-acceptance, not targeted hate, so it's no hate.\n\n   - Method: Consider the overall message and intent of the sentence, not just isolated words.\n\n3. **Evaluate Conditional Statements**: Statements that imply a condition under which a marginalized group could be acceptable are often hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Being a lesbian is fine if you really love being an animal\" suggests that being a lesbian is only acceptable under a derogatory condition, classifying it as hate.\n\n   - Method: Look for \"if\" statements that attach conditions to the acceptance of a group.\n\n4. **Look for Advocacy of Harm or Discrimination**: Statements that support or suggest harm, discrimination, or legal inequality against individuals or groups are hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Really, I hope she get raped in the future. Raping women should be legal I think\" advocates for violence and is classified as hate.\n\n   - Method: Identify any advocacy for violence, harm, or unequal treatment under the law.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Hate Speech and Venting Frustration**: Sometimes, strong language is used to express frustration or emotion without the intent to target or demean a group.\n\n   - Example: \"Im very glad to have friends\" is a positive statement without any hate, so it's no hate.\n\n   - Method: Determine if the strong language is directed at a specific group or if it's a general expression of emotion.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" with a focus on the content, context, and intent of the language used.",
