    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Emotional Keywords:\n   - Look for words that typically convey strong emotions, such as \"brilliant,\" \"disappointment,\" \"laughable,\" \"painful,\" etc.\n   - Example: \"brilliant\" in \"has created a brilliant motion picture\" suggests a very positive sentiment.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers and Negations:\n   - Words like \"very,\" \"so,\" \"too,\" can intensify the sentiment.\n   - Negations like \"doesn't,\" \"isn't,\" \"not,\" can reverse the sentiment.\n   - Example: \"doesn't work for me\" suggests a negative sentiment, but without strong emotional language, it's classified as neutral.\n\n3. Evaluate the Overall Tone:\n   - Assess if the sentence has a generally positive, negative, or neutral tone.\n   - Example: \"a huge disappointment\" indicates a very negative sentiment due to the strong negative tone.\n\n4. Look for Sarcasm or Irony:\n   - Sentences may contain sarcasm or irony, which can affect the sentiment classification.\n   - Example: \"in space, no one can hear you snore\" is sarcastic, contributing to a very negative sentiment.\n\n5. Contextual Clues:\n   - Some sentences may require understanding the context to classify sentiment accurately.\n   - Example: \"you want to call Domino's\" is context-dependent and without additional information is classified as neutral.\n\n6. Analyze Comparative or Conditional Phrases:\n   - Sentences with comparisons or conditions may have nuanced sentiments.\n   - Example: \"if the film has a problem, its shortness disappoints\" suggests a positive sentiment with a slight negative aspect, but overall remains positive.\n\nMethod of Applying the Rule:\n- Read the sentence carefully.\n- Identify and interpret emotional keywords, intensifiers, negations, and the overall tone.\n- Consider sarcasm, irony, and context.\n- Use comparative and conditional phrases to refine the sentiment.\n- Assign the sentiment category based on the strongest indicators in the sentence.",
