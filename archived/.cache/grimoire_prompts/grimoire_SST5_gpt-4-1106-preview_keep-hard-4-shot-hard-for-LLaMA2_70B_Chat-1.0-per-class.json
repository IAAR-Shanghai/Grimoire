    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Key Words: Look for words that typically indicate sentiment, such as \"disappointment,\" \"fun,\" \"uninteresting,\" or \"witty.\" \n   - Example: \"disappointment\" suggests a negative sentiment.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for emotionally charged words.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers: Words like \"very\" or \"utterly\" can amplify the sentiment.\n   - Example: \"a huge disappointment\" is more intense than just \"disappointment,\" indicating \"very negative.\"\n   - Method: Note the presence of intensifiers near key sentiment words.\n\n3. Evaluate Overall Meaning: Some sentences may contain mixed signals or sarcasm, requiring interpretation of the overall message.\n   - Example: \"laughable and compulsively watchable\" might seem contradictory, but the context suggests \"positive.\"\n   - Method: Read the full sentence to understand the context and overall sentiment.\n\n4. Look for Negations: Words like \"not\" can reverse the sentiment of the following words.\n   - Example: \"not a motion picture\" suggests a lack of something positive, indicating \"very negative.\"\n   - Method: Identify negations and consider their impact on the sentiment.\n\n5. Assess Comparative or Contrasting Phrases: Phrases that compare or contrast can indicate a positive or negative sentiment.\n   - Example: \"entertaining enough, but nothing new\" contrasts two ideas, with the second part suggesting \"negative.\"\n   - Method: Look for conjunctions like \"but\" that introduce contrasting ideas.\n\n6. Neutral Sentiments: Sentences that are factual, lack emotion, or are ambiguous may be classified as \"neutral.\"\n   - Example: \"you want to call Domino's\" is a statement without emotional content, indicating \"neutral.\"\n   - Method: If the sentence lacks emotional words or context, consider it neutral.\n\nApply these rules by scanning each sentence for the presence of key words, intensifiers, negations, and overall context to determine the sentiment. Use examples as a guide to understand how each rule can affect the classification. Keep the analysis concise and focused on the most impactful elements of the sentence.",
