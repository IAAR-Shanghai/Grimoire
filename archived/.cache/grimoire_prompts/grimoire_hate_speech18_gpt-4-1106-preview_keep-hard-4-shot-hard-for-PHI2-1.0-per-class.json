    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Negative Language or Stereotypes:**\n   - Look for derogatory terms, slurs, or negative stereotypes targeting a group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.\n   - Example: \"Here is possibly the best county to live in when one considers the Mud Index.\"\n   - Method: The term \"Mud Index\" could be interpreted as a derogatory term, hence classified as \"hate.\"\n\n2. **Assess Intent and Context:**\n   - Determine if the sentence is intended to harm, belittle, or express hostility towards a particular group.\n   - Example: \"But be careful what you say, some * * * * * * or anti-White supremacism person might say 'Can't we get over our petty differences like skin color or culture and get along.'\"\n   - Method: Despite the presence of censored language, the overall message does not express hate; it suggests overcoming differences, so it's classified as \"no hate.\"\n\n3. **Look for Generalizations and Accusations:**\n   - Check if the sentence makes unfounded generalizations or accusations against a group.\n   - Example: \"Sinners of the past did including your own people who sold you like cattle.\"\n   - Method: Although referencing a historical wrongdoing, it does not express hate towards a group in the present context, so it's \"no hate.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate Tone and Aggression:**\n   - Consider if the tone is aggressive or if the language is used to attack or demean.\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting.\"\n   - Method: While critical of a policy, it does not target a group with hate, so it's \"no hate.\"\n\n5. **Consider Advocacy for Harm or Discrimination:**\n   - Determine if the sentence advocates for harm, exclusion, or discrimination against a group.\n   - Example: \"We have to fight for our survival and our future but we can have our cake and eat it too.\"\n   - Method: The sentence is metaphorical and does not advocate for harm or discrimination, so it's \"no hate.\"\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on the presence of hate speech indicators, context, intent, and tone.",
