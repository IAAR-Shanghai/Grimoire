    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject and Predicate**: Determine the main subject and action (predicate) in both the statement and the question. For example, in the first example, the subject is \"Two bombs\" and the predicate is \"planted near an Islamic school in Pakistan.\"\n\n2. **Check for Consistency**: Compare the subject and predicate in the question with the information in the statement to see if they match. If the subject and predicate in the question are consistent with the statement, the answer is True; if not, it is False.\n\n3. **Look for Contradictory Information**: If the question contains information that directly contradicts the statement, the answer is False. For example, if the statement mentions \"docked with the International Space Station (ISS)\" and the question asks about docking with \"the Mir space station,\" it is False.\n\n4. **Inferential Reasoning**: Some questions may require inference based on the information provided. If the inference logically follows from the statement, the answer is True; if it does not, the answer is False.\n\n5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Do not make assumptions beyond the information given in the statement. Answer only based on the facts presented.\n\n6. **Contextual Clues**: Pay attention to contextual clues that can help determine the truthfulness of the question, such as time frames, locations, and specific details.\n\nApplying the Rules:\n\n- Read the statement and question carefully.\n- Identify the key subjects and predicates.\n- Compare the information in the question with the statement.\n- Look for direct contradictions or logical inferences.\n- Answer True if the question is consistent with the statement, False if it is not or if it contradicts the statement.\n\nExample Application:\n\nStatement: \"Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients.\"\nQuestion: \"Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.\"\nApplication: The subject \"Herceptin\" and the predicate \"can be used to treat breast cancer\" are consistent with the statement. Therefore, the answer is True.",

Don't assume anything not stated; use only the given facts to answer."
