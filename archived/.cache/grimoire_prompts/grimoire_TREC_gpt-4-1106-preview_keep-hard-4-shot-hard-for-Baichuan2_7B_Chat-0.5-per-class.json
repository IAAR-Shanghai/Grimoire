    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentence Topics:\n\n1. Abbreviation:\n   - Identify if the sentence asks about the meaning of a short form or acronym.\n   - Example: \"What does the abbreviation cwt. stand for?\"\n   - Method: Look for words like \"abbreviation,\" \"acronym,\" or \"short form.\"\n\n2. Entity:\n   - Determine if the sentence inquires about a thing, concept, or organization.\n   - Example: \"To what does Microsoft's Windows 3 owe its success?\"\n   - Method: Identify if the subject is a non-personal noun or a conceptual idea.\n\n3. Description:\n   - Check if the sentence seeks an explanation, definition, or characteristic.\n   - Example: \"What is the Bernoulli Principle?\"\n   - Method: Look for \"what is\" followed by a non-tangible concept or principle.\n\n4. Person:\n   - Ascertain if the sentence is about an individual or a group of people.\n   - Example: \"Who banned Pete Rose from baseball for betting on games?\"\n   - Method: Identify the use of \"who\" or if the subject is a known person or group.\n\n5. Location:\n   - Identify if the sentence is asking about a geographical place or venue.\n   - Example: \"Where is Natchitoches, Louisiana?\"\n   - Method: Look for \"where\" or if the subject is a place or establishment.\n\n6. Number:\n   - Determine if the sentence is looking for a quantity, date, or statistic.\n   - Example: \"How many head injuries are there in recreational ice skating each year?\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence contains \"how many,\" \"how much,\" \"when,\" or numerical data.\n\nApply these rules by first identifying key words or phrases that indicate the category, such as \"abbreviation,\" \"who,\" \"where,\" \"how many,\" or \"what is.\" Then, match the subject of the sentence to the appropriate category based on these indicators.",
