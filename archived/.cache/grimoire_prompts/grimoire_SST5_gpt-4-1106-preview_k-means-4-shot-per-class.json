Consider Intensity and Context:\n   - Words like \"one of the best\" or \"exquisite\" suggest a very strong positive sentiment.\n   - Phrases that imply a lack of something, e.g., \"lacking in suspense,\" indicate a negative sentiment.\n   - Mixed or ambiguous phrases, e.g., \"challenging film,\" suggest a neutral sentiment.\n\nMethod of Applying the Rule:\n   - Evaluate the intensity of the language used.\n   - Understand the context in which the words are used.\n   - Determine if the sentiment is strong, moderate, or neutral based on the intensity and context.\n\n3. Look for Modifiers:\n   - Words like \"almost,\" \"nearly,\" \"without\" can intensify or negate the sentiment.\n   - Phrases like \"neither as funny nor as charming\" suggest a very negative sentiment.\n\nMethod of Applying the Rule:\n   - Identify any modifiers that change the intensity of the sentiment.\n   - Assess how they affect the overall sentiment of the sentence.\n   - Adjust the sentiment classification accordingly.\n\nRemember to keep the explanation concise and focused on the key aspects of sentiment classification, using examples for clarity.",
