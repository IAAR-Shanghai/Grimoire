    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Solving the Task:\n\n1. **Identify Key Facts**: Extract the key facts from the provided statement and the question. For example, in the first example, the key facts are the number of soldiers and police officers killed.\n\n2. **Compare Facts**: Compare the facts in the question with those in the statement. If they match, the answer is True; if they don't, the answer is False. For instance, in the first example, the statement says nine soldiers and two police officers were killed, but the question says six policemen and two soldiers, which does not match, so the answer is False.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the context of both the statement and the question. For example, \"Polio is under control in the world\" is False because the statement specifies developed nations, not the entire world.\n\n4. **Generalization and Specificity**: Be wary of generalizations in the questions. If the question makes a broad claim that isn't supported by the specific information in the statement, the answer is likely False. For example, \"Mitsubishi sales rose 46 percent\" is False because the statement specifically says sales fell.\n\n5. **Temporal and Spatial Accuracy**: Ensure that the time and place mentioned in the question align with the statement. If the question omits or alters the timing or location, it may change the answer. For example, \"Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California\" is True because the timing and the event match the statement.\n\n6. **Implications and Inferences**: Determine if the question implies something not directly stated in the text. If it does, the answer is likely False. For example, \"A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut\" is True because it directly reflects the information given.\n\nMethod of Applying the Rule:\n\n- Read the statement and question carefully.\n- Identify and note the key facts from both.\n- Compare these facts to see if they align.\n- Consider the context, and beware of generalizations.\n- Check for temporal and spatial accuracy.\n- Evaluate implications and inferences.\n- Decide if the question is True or False based on the comparison.\n\nKeep the explanations concise and focused on the method of comparison and verification of facts.",
