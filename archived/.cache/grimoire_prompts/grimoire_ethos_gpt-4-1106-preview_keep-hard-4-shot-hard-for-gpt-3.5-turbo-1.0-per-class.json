    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence as \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Discriminatory Language**: Look for words or phrases that directly attack or demean a group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation.\n\n   - Example: \"Abortion is a solution for autism\" implies a negative view of autism, classifying it as hate.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for keywords that target specific groups in a derogatory manner.\n\n2. **Assess Stereotyping or Generalizations**: Determine if the sentence makes broad, negative generalizations about a group.\n\n   - Example: \"Every female-dominated job: low skill; minimal education required; not much physical exertion; indoors; tightly controlled hours\" stereotypes a gender group, classifying it as hate.\n   - Method: Evaluate if the sentence attributes negative characteristics to an entire group without exceptions.\n\n3. **Evaluate Intent and Context**: Consider if the sentence is intended to insult, mock, or belittle individuals or groups.\n\n   - Example: \"Watching this kid trying to step up and walk with that crutches is the best thing in the world. So idiot\" uses \"idiot\" in a context that seems mocking, classifying it as hate.\n   - Method: Look beyond the words to the meaning and tone implied.\n\n4. **Check for Mocking Accents or Cultural Traits**: Sentences that mock someone's accent or cultural traits can be considered hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Hello I'm calling from tech support *with Indian accent*\" mocks an accent, classifying it as hate.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is ridiculing cultural or linguistic characteristics.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Hate Speech and Negative Remarks**: Not all negative comments are hate speech. They must target a protected group to be classified as hate.\n\n   - Example: \"Head looks like a big ass jelly bean\" is a negative remark but does not target a protected group, so it's classified as no hate.\n   - Method: Determine if the negative comment is directed at an individual's characteristics that are not related to a protected group.\n\n6. **Consider Calls for Action**: Statements that suggest a group needs to be treated differently or negatively can be hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"Anyone who can't cope as the gender they are born needs SERIOUS psychological therapy!!!\" does not directly incite hate or discrimination, so it's classified as no hate.\n   - Method: Look for language that suggests a group should be subjected to different standards or actions based on their identity.\n\n7. **Analyze Comparative Statements**: Sentences that compare the status or privilege of different groups need careful examination.\n\n   - Example: \"Sorry but black Americans are more in danger than homosexuals. Homosexuals have so much privilege now. More than African Americans, Latinos, Arabs\" is a comparative statement that does not inherently contain hate speech, so it's classified as no hate.\n   - Method: Assess if the comparison is made to belittle or dehumanize a group.\n\nRemember, context is key, and some sentences may require a deeper understanding of the nuances involved. Always consider the broader societal and cultural implications of the language used.",

Look for words that insult or belittle a group based on identity (race, gender, etc.).\n2. Check if it unfairly stereotypes or generalizes a group negatively.\n3. Determine if the intent is to mock or demean someone based on cultural or identity traits.\n\nNegative comments aren't always hate speech unless they target a protected group. Context matters."
