    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify the sentiment of a sentence into subjective or objective, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Factual Statements**: Objective sentences typically present facts, descriptions, or information without personal feelings or opinions. \n   - Example: \"The main story involves an innocent teenage boy and a conniving teenage girl who meet on a beach one summer in southern Brazil.\"\n   - Method: Look for statements that describe events, characters, or settings without using emotive language or personal judgment.\n\n2. **Check for Opinion Indicators**: Subjective sentences often contain words that indicate opinions, beliefs, or emotions, such as \"beautiful,\" \"terrible,\" \"I think,\" or \"I feel.\"\n   - Example: \"I think the main story is captivating and beautifully written.\"\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for words or phrases that reflect personal perspective or evaluation.\n\n3. **Assess the Presence of Bias**: If the sentence seems to lean towards a particular viewpoint or is trying to persuade, it may be subjective.\n   - Example: \"The main story is a masterpiece that everyone should read.\"\n   - Method: Determine if the sentence is trying to influence the reader's opinion.\n\n4. **Look for Reporting Verbs**: Sentences that use reporting verbs like \"says,\" \"reports,\" \"claims,\" etc., can indicate an objective tone if they are relaying information without adding personal commentary.\n   - Example: \"The author says the main story is based on true events.\"\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is simply conveying information from a source.\n\n5. **Determine the Purpose of the Sentence**: If the sentence's purpose is to inform or describe without attempting to influence the reader's emotions or opinions, it is likely objective.\n   - Example: \"The focus of this story takes place at an annual drag-racing event in Fresno.\"\n   - Method: Consider the intent behind the sentenceâ€”is it to inform or to persuade?\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences as subjective or objective. Remember that objective sentences state facts or information neutrally, while subjective sentences include personal opinions, emotions, or biases.",
