    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Sentiment Classification:\n\n1. Identify Positive or Negative Keywords:\n   - Positive: Words like \"great,\" \"ingeniously,\" \"fun,\" \"brilliant,\" \"educational,\" \"intoxicating,\" \"laughable,\" \"compulsively watchable,\" \"study,\" and \"wonder.\"\n   - Negative: Words like \"doesn't deliver,\" \"unsophisticated,\" \"disappointment,\" \"letdown,\" \"uninteresting,\" \"mess,\" \"dull,\" \"wooden,\" \"old-fashioned,\" \"outdated,\" and \"strains.\"\n\n   Method: Scan the sentence for these keywords. Their presence typically indicates the sentiment.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers and Degree Modifiers:\n   - Very Positive/Negative: Phrases like \"a huge disappointment,\" \"a big letdown,\" \"more ingeniously constructed,\" \"brilliant motion picture,\" \"philosophically, intellectually and logistically a mess,\" and \"it's uninteresting.\"\n   - Positive/Negative: Absence of strong modifiers or presence of moderate praise or criticism.\n\n   Method: Look for words that amplify the sentiment, such as \"very,\" \"huge,\" \"big,\" \"brilliant,\" or \"ingeniously.\" These often signal a very positive or very negative sentiment.\n\n3. Contextual Clues and Sarcasm:\n   - Sentences may contain sarcasm or contextual clues that invert the meaning of the keywords.\n   - Example: \"It's at once laughable and compulsively watchable, in its committed dumbness.\" The word \"laughable\" might seem negative, but the context makes it positive.\n\n   Method: Read the whole sentence to understand the context. Look for phrases that might indicate sarcasm or a twist in meaning.\n\n4. Neutral Sentiments:\n   - Sentences that lack strong positive or negative language or express uncertainty or ambiguity.\n   - Example: \"There's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane.\" or \"Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.\"\n\n   Method: Identify sentences that present facts without emotion or contain mixed sentiments that cancel each other out.\n\n5. Special Cases:\n   - Imperatives or non-opinion statements, like \"You want to call Domino's,\" are typically neutral unless they contain sentiment keywords.\n   - Sentences that may seem positive or negative but are factual or lack clear sentiment.\n\n   Method: Treat imperatives or non-opinion statements as neutral unless sentiment is clearly expressed.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences into the appropriate category. Remember to consider the overall context and not just individual words.",
