    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. Identify Targeted Groups or Stereotypes:\n   - Look for language that targets a specific group based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or any other social category.\n   - Example: \"reds are just SO naive!\" targets a group and implies naivety, indicating hate.\n   - Method: Scan for keywords that refer to groups and assess if the context is negative or derogatory.\n\n2. Look for Generalizations and Derogatory Language:\n   - Generalizations apply a characteristic to all members of a group without exception.\n   - Derogatory language includes insults, slurs, or any language that demeans a group.\n   - Example: \"you can take the ape out of the jungle...\" uses a derogatory metaphor for a group, indicating hate.\n   - Method: Identify phrases that oversimplify or degrade a group and evaluate their intent.\n\n3. Assess Context for Offensiveness:\n   - Determine if the sentence is likely to offend or harm the dignity of any group.\n   - Example: \"Many Asians will see something once and memorize it...\" suggests a stereotype, indicating hate.\n   - Method: Consider the potential impact of the statement on the targeted group.\n\n4. Distinguish Between Criticism and Hate Speech:\n   - Criticism is directed at actions or policies and does not target or stereotype a group.\n   - Hate speech is directed at a group and is inherently derogatory or demeaning.\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting.\" criticizes a policy, not a group, indicating no hate.\n   - Method: Focus on whether the criticism is aimed at behavior/policy or at a group's characteristics.\n\n5. Evaluate Tone and Intent:\n   - Tone can indicate whether a statement is meant to be hateful or simply a blunt observation.\n   - Intent refers to whether the speaker aims to spread hate or is making a neutral statement.\n   - Example: \"Sinners of the past did including your own people who sold you like cattle.\" may be a historical reference without hate intent, indicating no hate.\n   - Method: Analyze the tone and look for cues of malicious intent.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on the presence of targeted derogatory language, generalizations, context, and the distinction between criticism and hate speech.",
