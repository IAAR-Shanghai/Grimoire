    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these summarized rules:\n\n1. **Identify Hate Speech Indicators:**\n   - Look for words or phrases that target a group based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc.\n   - Example: \"All [group] are criminals\" is hate speech.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for derogatory terms or generalizations about a group.\n\n2. **Assess Context and Tone:**\n   - Determine if the language is aggressive, disrespectful, or intended to harm.\n   - Example: \"I hate [group]\" indicates hate speech, while \"I hate broccoli\" does not.\n   - Method: Consider the sentence's context and the potential impact on the targeted group.\n\n3. **Look for Incitement to Violence:**\n   - Check if the sentence encourages harm or violence against individuals or groups.\n   - Example: \"Someone should teach [group] a lesson\" implies hate speech.\n   - Method: Identify calls to action that suggest physical harm or intimidation.\n\n4. **Evaluate for Exclusion or Discrimination:**\n   - Determine if the sentence promotes exclusion or discrimination against a protected group.\n   - Example: \"No [group] allowed\" is hate speech.\n   - Method: Look for statements that advocate for unequal treatment or segregation.\n\n5. **Consider Intent and Sarcasm:**\n   - Be aware that sarcasm or satire may complicate classification.\n   - Example: \"Yeah, right, like all [group] are geniuses\" could be sarcastic.\n   - Method: Use contextual clues to discern the speaker's true intent.\n\n6. **Use Reliable Classification Tools:**\n   - If available, employ automated tools or guidelines provided by reputable organizations for consistency.\n   - Example: AI-based text analysis tools can help classify sentences.\n   - Method: Input the sentence into the tool and review the classification, using human judgment as necessary.\n\nRemember, the classification should be based on the content of the sentence and not personal opinions or biases. If a sentence does not clearly fall into the \"hate\" category, it should be classified as \"no hate.\"",
