    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nRules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. **Identify Discriminatory Language:**\n   - Look for words or phrases that target a specific group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or any other characteristic.\n   - Example: \"filthy jews\" is targeting a religious group and is considered hate speech.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for derogatory terms or stereotypes associated with a particular group.\n\n2. **Assess Context for Hostility or Prejudice:**\n   - Determine if the sentence expresses negative emotions or hostility towards a group.\n   - Example: \"mr whitey would be branded a big bad evil racist\" implies a prejudiced view against a racial group.\n   - Method: Read the sentence to understand the tone and intent. Look for words that convey anger, resentment, or disdain.\n\n3. **Check for Generalizations or Assumptions:**\n   - Be cautious of sentences that make sweeping generalizations about a group.\n   - Example: \"the little shops were all white runned and owned\" suggests a biased assumption about race and business ownership.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is making a broad statement about a group without evidence or individual distinction.\n\n4. **Evaluate for Advocacy of Harm or Exclusion:**\n   - Sentences that suggest harm, exclusion, or inferiority of a group are classified as hate.\n   - Example: \"reds are just SO naive\" could imply a desire to exploit or demean a political group.\n   - Method: Look for phrases that suggest taking advantage of, excluding, or harming a group.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Opinion and Hate Speech:**\n   - Recognize that not all strong opinions or criticisms are hate speech.\n   - Example: \"Wow this policy of prosecuting people for offending liberals is disgusting\" is an opinion about a policy, not hate speech.\n   - Method: Separate personal or political opinions from statements that attack or dehumanize a group.\n\n6. **Consider the Overall Message:**\n   - Review the sentence as a whole to understand the overarching message.\n   - Example: \"We have to fight for our survival and our future but we can have our cake and eat it too\" does not target any group and is not hate speech.\n   - Method: Synthesize the information from the sentence to determine if the primary message is hateful or not.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on the presence of discriminatory language, context of hostility, generalizations, advocacy of harm, and the overall message.",
