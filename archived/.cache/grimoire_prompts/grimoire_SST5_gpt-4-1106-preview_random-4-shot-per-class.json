    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nSummary of Sentiment Classification Rules:\n\n1. Identify Key Words and Phrases:\n   - Look for words that typically convey emotions, such as \"credible,\" \"uncanny,\" \"haunting,\" \"compelling,\" \"bad,\" \"great,\" etc.\n   - Example: \"truly bad movie\" indicates a negative sentiment.\n\n2. Consider Intensifiers and Diminishers:\n   - Intensifiers like \"very\" or \"completely\" amplify the sentiment.\n   - Diminishers like \"not\" or \"lacks\" reduce the sentiment or flip its polarity.\n   - Example: \"very compelling\" suggests a very positive sentiment.\n\n3. Evaluate the Overall Context:\n   - Assess if the sentence has a positive or negative slant overall.\n   - Example: \"lacks emphasis on music\" is neutral as it's a factual observation without strong sentiment.\n\n4. Apply Sentiment to the Right Category:\n   - Very Positive: Strong positive language with intensifiers.\n   - Positive: Positive language without strong intensifiers.\n   - Neutral: Factual, lacking strong positive or negative language.\n   - Negative: Negative language without strong intensifiers.\n   - Very Negative: Strong negative language with intensifiers.\n   - Example: \"truly, truly bad movie\" is classified as very negative due to the use of \"truly\" as an intensifier.\n\n5. Use Examples for Calibration:\n   - Compare new sentences to the provided examples to gauge the sentiment level.\n   - Example: If a sentence is similar in tone to \"filled with haunting and sublime music,\" it should be classified as very positive.\n\nBy following these rules, you can classify the sentiment of sentences into the appropriate category. Remember to consider the context and not to rely solely on individual words.",
