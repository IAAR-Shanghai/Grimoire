    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo solve the task of determining whether a statement is true or false based on provided information, follow these rules:\n\n1. Identify Key Information:\n   - Extract the main subject and predicate from the question.\n   - Example: For \"What is the average amount of time men serve as missionaries?\" the key information is \"men\" and \"average amount of time served as missionaries.\"\n\n2. Compare with Provided Information:\n   - Match the key information from the question with the relevant part of the provided information.\n   - Example: Match \"men\" and \"average amount of time served as missionaries\" with \"Men typically serve for two-years.\"\n\n3. Determine Truth Value:\n   - If the provided information directly supports or contradicts the key information in the question, then the answer is True or False respectively.\n   - Example: Since \"Men typically serve for two-years\" supports the question, the answer is True.\n\n4. Apply Contextual Understanding:\n   - Some questions may require understanding the context or implications of the provided information.\n   - Example: If the question is about a historical event, ensure the provided information is from the correct time period.\n\n5. Answer Concisely:\n   - After evaluating the information, respond with only \"True\" or \"False\" as the answer.\n\nRemember, the goal is to assess whether the provided information validates the statement in the question. If it does, the answer is True; if it contradicts or does not provide enough evidence, the answer is False.",
