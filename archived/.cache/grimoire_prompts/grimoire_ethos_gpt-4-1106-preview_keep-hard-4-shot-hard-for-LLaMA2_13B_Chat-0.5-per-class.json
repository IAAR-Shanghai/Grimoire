    "profound_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify a sentence into \"hate\" or \"no hate,\" follow these rules:\n\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups or Individuals**: Check if the sentence targets a specific group (e.g., race, religion, gender, sexual orientation) or individual with negative connotations.\n\n   - Example: \"Christians are all demonic\" targets a religious group negatively.\n   - Method: Look for keywords that indicate a group or individual and assess the sentiment.\n\n2. **Assess Sentiment and Intent**: Determine if the sentence expresses negative sentiment or intent to harm or demean.\n\n   - Example: \"I love deaf people. I can scream on them and I can scold them\" has a negative sentiment despite the word \"love.\"\n   - Method: Analyze the context and underlying message, not just isolated positive words.\n\n3. **Look for Violent or Aggressive Language**: Sentences that incite violence or use aggressive language are classified as hate.\n\n   - Example: \"KILL THOSE TERRORISTS\" uses aggressive language.\n   - Method: Identify verbs and phrases that suggest violence or aggression.\n\n4. **Consider the Use of Stereotypes or Insults**: Sentences that rely on stereotypes or direct insults are often hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"By calling period, a natural procedure, as an excuse it degrades their gender\" uses a stereotype to degrade.\n   - Method: Look for generalizations or derogatory terms used to describe a group.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Context**: Sometimes, the context can change the classification, especially if a sentence is sarcastic or ironic.\n\n   - Example: \"T-Rex mated with a donkey\" is a nonsensical statement without hate context.\n   - Method: Consider the overall message and the potential for irony or sarcasm.\n\n6. **Check for Affirmative or Supportive Statements**: Sentences that express support or affirmation, even if mentioning a group, are not hate speech.\n\n   - Example: \"LOVE IS LOVE!!! God excepts everyone...\" is an affirmative statement.\n   - Method: Identify if the sentence is promoting inclusivity or positivity.\n\nBy applying these rules, you can classify sentences into \"hate\" or \"no hate\" based on their content, sentiment, and context.",
