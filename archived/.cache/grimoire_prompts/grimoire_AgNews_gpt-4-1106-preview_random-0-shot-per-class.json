    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nTo classify sentences into the categories of World, Sports, Business, or Technology, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Keyword Identification**:\n   - Look for specific words that are commonly associated with each category.\n   - Example: \"soccer\" typically indicates Sports, \"stocks\" might suggest Business, \"internet\" could relate to Technology, and \"election\" is likely World.\n   - Method: Scan the sentence for such keywords to guide your classification.\n\n2. **Context Understanding**:\n   - Consider the broader context of the sentence, not just isolated words.\n   - Example: \"Apple\" could mean Technology if referring to the company, but Business if discussing stock prices.\n   - Method: Read the full sentence to understand the context before classifying.\n\n3. **Elimination Process**:\n   - Rule out categories that clearly do not fit the sentence.\n   - Example: If the sentence has nothing to do with sports, eliminate the Sports category.\n   - Method: Narrow down the options by eliminating the least likely categories first.\n\n4. **Subject Matter Expertise**:\n   - Use your knowledge of current events and trends in each category.\n   - Example: If a sentence mentions a recent technological innovation, it likely falls under Technology.\n   - Method: Apply your understanding of the subject matter to inform your classification.\n\nKeep the explanation concise and focus on the application of these rules to classify sentences effectively.",
