    "deluxe_grimoire": "\nBelow are some skills needed to solve the task; you need to carefully learn and consider the process and methods step by step:\n\nSummary of Rules for Classifying Sentences into Hate/No Hate:\n\n1. Identify Hate Speech Indicators:\n   - Hate speech often includes derogatory language, slurs, or negative stereotypes targeting a group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.\n   - Example: A sentence with the phrase \"mr whitey would be branded a big bad evil racist\" indicates hate due to the use of a negative stereotype targeting a racial group.\n\n2. Context Matters:\n   - Consider the context of the sentence. Sometimes, a sentence may contain words that are typically associated with hate speech but are used in a non-hateful way.\n   - Example: \"I did not see any reliable sources, that connect Leon Trotski and Lenin to the Freemasons.\" Although it mentions historical figures, there is no hate speech present.\n\n3. Look for Expressions of Discontent or Prejudice:\n   - Sentences expressing general discontent or frustration without targeting a specific group are not considered hate speech.\n   - Example: \"So sick of the way its working\" is a general expression of discontent, not hate speech.\n\n4. Analyze Sentences for Implicit Bias:\n   - Some sentences may not have explicit hate speech but may imply bias or prejudice through subtle language choices.\n   - Example: \"Typical i suppose in the eyes of the law he is just another tourist beaten on sydneys streets\" implies a bias based on the subsequent comparison to \"a poor black fella.\"\n\n5. Apply the Rule:\n   - Read the sentence carefully and identify if any of the hate speech indicators are present.\n   - Consider the context and whether the sentence targets a specific group negatively.\n   - Determine if the sentence expresses or implies bias or prejudice.\n   - If any of these conditions are met, classify the sentence as \"hate.\" Otherwise, classify it as \"no hate.\"\n\nRemember to keep the analysis concise and focused on the presence of hate speech indicators, context, and expressions of bias or prejudice.",
